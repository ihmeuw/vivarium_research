Maternal disorders: GBD 2021, MNCNH
===================================

.. note::

    This page is adapted from the previously developed :ref:`GBD 2021
    maternal disorders cause model <2021_cause_maternal_disorders>`,
    which was updated from the :ref:`GBD 2019 maternal disorders cause
    model <2019_cause_maternal_disorders>`. In contrast to previous
    versions of the model, in the :ref:`MNCNH Portfolio project
    <2024_concept_model_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio>`  we are modeling
    several of the maternal disorders subcauses (see `Modeled
    Subcauses`_) rather than modeling a single overarching cause. This
    page documents the strategy for capturing the burden of the
    remaining maternal disorders subcauses that are not explicitly
    modeled.

Modeled Subcauses
-----------------

The following maternal disorders subcauses will be modeled individually:

    :maxdepth: 1

    maternal_hemorrhage
    maternal_sepsis
    obstructed_labor

The remainder of this document describes maternal disorders overall and
describes the strategy for capturing the burden of the maternal
disorders subcauses that are not explicitly modeled above.
