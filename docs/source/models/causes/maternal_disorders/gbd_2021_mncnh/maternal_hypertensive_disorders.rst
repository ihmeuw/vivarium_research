  Develop and document a cause model document for maternal hypertensive disorders for the MNCNH portfolio simulation

.. note::

  The modeling strategy for the :ref:`residual maternal disorders cause <2021_cause_residual_maternal_disorders_mncnh>` was developed to include mortality due to maternal hypertensive disorders as the hypertensive disorders cause was not modeled in the MNCNH portfolio simulation at the time that the residual maternal disorders cause was implemented. 

  When the maternal hypertensive disorders cause is added to the MNCNH simulation, the :ref:`residual maternal disorders cause <2021_cause_residual_maternal_disorders_mncnh>` modeling strategy will need to be updated to exclude mortality due to maternal hypertensive disorders so that we do not double count these deaths in our simulation.
