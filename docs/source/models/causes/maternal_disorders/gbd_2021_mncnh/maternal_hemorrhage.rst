Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

The goal of the maternal hemorrhage model is to capture YLLs and YLDs due to
maternal hemorrhage among women of reproductive age. We only model maternal 
hemorrhage among simulants who give (live or still) birth after a full term 
pregnancy. This page documents how to model the baseline burden of maternal 
hemorrhage. Other simulation components such as c-sections will affect the 
rates of maternal hemorrhage; such effects will be described on the pages 
for the corresponding :ref:`intervention <intervention_models>` or 
:ref:`risk effects <risk_effects_models>` model.

Summary of modeling strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since the :ref:`MNCNH Portfolio project
<2024_concept_model_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio>` does not model the
passage of time, we will not model maternal hemorrhage as a state machine
with dynamic state transitions like our typical cause models. Rather,
all "transitions" in the model will be modeled as decisions made during
a single timestep. To obtain the decision probabilities of each incident
case or maternal hemorrhage death, we will convert GBD's annual incidence
and mortality rates among women of reproductive age into event rates
*per birth* (including stillbirths). We will track maternal hemorrhage
deaths to calculate YLLs, and we will track incident cases to calculate
YLDs.

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cause Model Diagram
+++++++++++++++++++

Although we're not modeling hemorrhage dynamically as a finite state
machine, we can draw an analogous directed graph that can be interpreted
as a (collapsed) decision tree rather than a state transition diagram.
The main difference is that the values on the transition arrows
represent decision probabilities rather than rates per unit time. The
maternal hemorrhage decision graph drawn below should be inserted on the
"full term pregnancy" branch of the decision graph from the
:ref:`pregnancy model <other_models_pregnancy_closed_cohort_mncnh>`,
between the intrapartum model and the birth of the child simulant. Solid
lines are the pieces added by the maternal hemorrhage model, while dashed
lines indicate pieces of the underlying pregnancy model.

Data Tables
+++++++++++

The maternal hemorrhage cause model requires two probabilities, the
incidence risk (ir) per birth and the case fatality rate (cfr), for use
in the decision graph. The incidence risk per birth will be computed as

.. math::

    \text{ir} = \frac{\text{hemorrhage cases}}{\text{births}}
        = \frac{\text{(hemorrhage cases) / person-time}}
            {\text{births / person-time}}
        = \frac{\text{hemorrhage incidence rate}}{\text{birth rate}}.

The case fatality rate will be computed as

.. math::

    \begin{align*}
    \text{cfr} &= \frac{\text{hemorrhage deaths}}{\text{hemorrhage cases}} \\
        &= \frac{\text{(hemorrhage deaths) / person-time}}
            {\text{(hemorrhage cases) / person-time}}
        = \frac{\text{hemorrhage cause specific mortality rate}}
            {\text{hemorrhage incidence rate}}.
    \end{align*}

The following table shows the data needed from GBD for these
calculations as well as for the calculation of YLDs in the next section.

.. note::

    All quantities pulled from GBD in the following table are for a
    specific year, sex, age group, and location unless otherwise noted
    (e.g., SBR). Our simulation only includes pregnant women of
    reproductive age, so the sex will always be female. However, even
    though all of our simulants will be pregnant, we still pull each
    quantity for *all* females in a given year, age group, and location,
    because this is the default behavior of GBD. Since we are using the
    same total population in all the denominators, the person-time will
    cancel out in the above calculations to give us the probabilities we
    want.

        condition prevalence. Total population person-time is used in
