Cause Hierarchy
+++++++++++++++

- All causes (c_294) [level 0]

  - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (c_295)

    - Maternal disorders and neonatal disorders (c_962)

      - Maternal disorders (c_366)

        - Maternal hemorrhage (c_367)

          - Maternal hemorrhage with less than 1 liter blood loss (s_180)

          - Maternal hemorrhage with greater than 1 liter blood loss (s_181)

          - Mild anemia due to maternal hemorrhage (s_182)

          - Moderate anemia due to maternal hemorrhage (s_183)

          - Severe anemia due to maternal hemorrhage (s_184)

*Maternal hemorrhage (c_367)* ia a most detailed cause, at level 4 of the GBD hierarchy. 
It has five sequelae, detailed in the following table:

The following table describes any restrictions in GBD 2021 on the
effects of this cause (such as being only fatal or only nonfatal), as
well as restrictions on the ages and sexes to which the cause applies.
