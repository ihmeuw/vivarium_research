  Update this model to include the new cause IDs for GBD 2023

The residual maternal disorders cause is meant to capture outcomes due to 
maternal disorders that are not otherwise modeled in our simulation.

Disease Overview

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

The goal of the residual maternal disorders model is to capture YLLs and YLDs due to
maternal disorders subcauses other than those included in the
:ref:`abortion/miscarriage/ectopic pregnancy maternal disorders subcauses <2021_cause_abortion_miscarriage_ectopic_pregnancy_causes_mncnh>`
that are not otherwise modeled in the MNCNH simulation.
Given that the maternal disorders subcauses specific to abortion/miscarriage/ectopic pregnancies are separately modeled 
(:ref:`abortion/miscarriage/ectopic pregnancy maternal disorders document <2021_cause_abortion_miscarriage_ectopic_pregnancy_causes_mncnh>`), 
we will only model residual maternal disorders among simulants who give (live or still) 
birth.

A list of maternal disorders subcauses and whether they are modeled elsewhere or will
be covered as part of the residual maternal disorders cause modeling strategy in this
document is included in the table below.

Summary of modeling strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will model morbidity and mortality due to residual maternal disorders (inclusive of all maternal disorders
subcauses that are otherwise unmodeled in our simulation) that
occurs at an equal probability among all pregnancies that end in live or still birth (according to the :ref:`pregnancy model document <other_models_pregnancy_closed_cohort_mncnh>`). 
We do not require tracking incident cases of residual maternal disorders, nor any quantities specific to 
subcauses included in the residual maternal disorders cause model.

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- We apply morbidity due to subcauses of residual maternal disorders equally across all live/stillbirth pregnancies rather than applying the value of YLDs per incident case to a subset of incident cases

Cause Model Diagram
+++++++++++++++++++

Conceptually, the modeling strategy for the residual maternal disorders cause can be summarized with the diagram below. All live/stillbirth pregnancies will be assigned an amount of YLDs due to residual maternal disorders at the conclusion of the intrapartum period. Some of these pregnancies will die from residual maternal disorders in accordance with the calculated fatality rate (fr) of residual maternal disorders. Regardless of whether the parent dies due to residual maternal disorders, the intrapartum period will conclude with a live or still birth outcome.

    }

    * - end
      -
    * - fr (fatality rate)
      - The rate of death due to residual maternal disorders among all pregnancies resulting in live or still births 

While the above diagram represents the conceptual aims of the residual maternal disorders cause model, there are some convenient adjustments we can make to this diagram so that it continues to achieve the aims of our cause model while also achieving compatibility with the existing implementation of the `MaternalDisorder component <http://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_gates_mncnh/blob/main/src/vivarium_gates_mncnh/components/maternal_disorders.py>`_ used in the MNCNH simulation that has been used to model other maternal disorders subcauses such as :ref:`maternal sepsis <2021_cause_maternal_sepsis_mncnh>`. Specifically, although our modeling strategy for maternal disorders does not involve modeling incident cases, we can implement a :code:`MaternalDisorder` component model as represented in the diagram below with an incidence risk (ir) value equal to 1.

**Implementation-driven cause model diagram:**

      - Parent simulant has a live birth or stillbirth pregnancy as determined by the

        <other_models_pregnancy_closed_cohort_mncnh>`, **and** has
        already been through the pregnancy and intrapartum components
    * - affected with residual maternal disorders
      - Parent is "affected with" residual maternal disorders 
    * - parent did not die of residual maternal disorders
      - Parent simulant did not die of residual maternal disorders
    * - parent died of residual maternal disorders
      - Parent simulant died of residual maternal disorders
    * - live birth or stillbirth
      - The parent simulant has given birth to a child simulant (which
        may be a live birth or a still birth)
    * - ir (incidence risk)
      - The probability that a pregnancy resulting in live or still birth becomes "affected with" residual maternal disorders and experiences associated morbidity
    * - cfr (case fatality rate)
      - The rate of death due to residual maternal disorders among those "affected with" residual maternal disorders

.. note::

  The concept of being "affected with" residual maternal disorders as shown in this diagram does exists only for convenience of implementation, as we do not have relevant data to inform the incidence of residual maternal disorders. Setting the ir parameter to 1 allows all pregnancies resulting in live or still birth to be subject to equal rates of morbidity and mortality due to residual maternal disorders, which is the aim of our modeling strategy for this cause.

Data Tables
+++++++++++

.. note::

    All quantities pulled from GBD in the following table are for a
    specific year, sex, age group, and location unless otherwise noted
    (e.g., SBR). Our simulation only includes pregnant women of
    reproductive age, so the sex will always be female. However, even
    though all of our simulants will be pregnant, we still pull each
    quantity for *all* females in a given year, age group, and location,
    because this is the default behavior of GBD. Since we are using the
    same total population in all the denominators, the person-time will
    cancel out in the above calculations to give us the probabilities we
    want.

      - sum of cause-specific mortality rates across causes [375, 379, 376, 741, 369]

      - YLDs accumulated due to residual maternal disorders per case of residual maternal disorders (live/stillbirth pregnancy)
      - yld_rate / birth_rate
      - 

- The ylds_per_case parameter should be applied to all simulants affected by residual maternal disorders (equivalent to all live or still birth pregnancies)
- The cfr (case fatality rate) parameter should be applied to all simulants affected by residual maternal disorders (equivalent to all live or still birth pregnancies)

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

- Deaths due to residual maternal disorders should occur among pregnancies that end in live or still births only
- Mortality, YLL, and YLDs rate due to residual maternal disorders should match expectation in the baseline scenario
