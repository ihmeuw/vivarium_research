Cause Hierarchy
+++++++++++++++

- All causes (c_294) [level 0]

  - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (c_295)

    - Maternal disorders and neonatal disorders (c_962)

      - Maternal disorders (c_366)

        - **Obstructed labor and uterine rupture (c_370)**

            - Obstructed labor, acute event (s_188)

            - Rectovaginal fistula (s_189)

            - Vesicovaginal fistula (s_190)

*Obstructed labor and uterine rupture (c_370)* is a most
detailed cause, at level 4 of the GBD hierarchy. It has three sequelae,
detailed in the following table:

    :widths: 2 1 5 5

    * - Sequela
      - GBD ID
      - Health state and disability weight
      - Notes
    * - Obstructed labor, acute event 
      - s_188
      - abdominopelvic problem, severe 

        DW: 0.324 (0.22–0.442) 
      - 
    * - Rectovaginal fistula 
      - s_189
      - rectovaginal fistula 

        DW: 0.501 (0.339–0.657)
      - The non-fatal burden of fistulas is included in the non-fatal 
        burden of obstructed labour in reporting, but estimation is 
        described in a separate appendix section on “Fistula – impairment.”
    * - Vesicovaginal fistula
      - s_190
      - vesicovaginal fistula

        DW: 0.342 (0.227–0.478)
