Neonatal disorders: GBD 2021, MNCNH

.. note::

    This page is adapted from the :ref:`Maternal disorders: GBD 2021, MNCNH <2021_cause_maternal_disorders_mncnh>` page and is also part of the :ref:`MNCNH Portfolio project
    <2024_concept_model_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio>`.  In this work we are modeling
    several neonatal subcauses (see `Modeled
    Subcauses`_) which is complicated because the LBWSG risk factor in GBD acts on overall neonatal mortality.

The remainder of this document describes neonatal disorders overall and
the strategy for capturing the burden of the neonatal subcauses to calibrate to all-cause mortality, preterm paf-of-one, and LBWSG risk.
