TB Overview
-----------

TB definitions
++++++++++++++
Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. It most commonly affects the lungs, although it can affect
other parts of the body. TB can be fatal if not recognized and treated.
It also can spread from person to person to infect others. Anyone who 
inhales the airborne droplets that contains TB bacteria is called a "contact".
A contact can be someone who living with the person who has infectious TB,
like a family member, friend, or coworker. [UpToDate]_

What is latent TB?
++++++++++++++++++
Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is defined as a state of persistent
immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens with
no evidence of clinically manifest active TB. [WHO]_

What is active TB?
++++++++++++++++++
Active tuberculosis, also known as reactivation TB. It occurs when individual's
immune system becomes weakened and is no longer able to contain the latent
bacteria; then the TB bacteria become "active", overwhelm the immune system and
cause a person to become ill. [UpToDate]_ In GBD, active TB consist of 6 child
causes: Drug-susceptible TB, Multidrug-resistant TB, Extensively drug-resistant
TB, HIV/AIDS - Drug-susceptible TB, HIV/AIDS - Multidrug-resistant TB, and
HIV/AIDS - Extensively drug-resistant TB.

TB progression
++++++++++++++
Active TB disease developed within 2 years called fast progression, Individuals
who do not have rapid progression are classified as having slow-progressing latent
tuberculosis infection. With latent infection, individuals experience no adverse
health effects and will not transmit Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but they face
an ongoing risk of developing active tuberculosis through reactivation.

GBD 2017 Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
GBD 2017 TB model made a refinement in the mortality-to-incidence (MI) ratio
regression approach upon 2016 model. The SDI was replaced by Healthcare Access
and Quality index (HAQI) in the MI ratio regression. First, GBD estimated
risk-weighted prevalence of LTBI by demographic characteristics using data from
population-based tuberculin surveys and cohort studies reporting the risk of
developing active TB disease as a function of induration size. Next, they
divided the inputs on prevalence, incidence, and cause-specific mortality rate
(CSMR) by the risk-weighted LTBI prevalence in order to model TB among at risk
populatoin. GBD ran a mixed effects regression (with region random effects)
using logit transformed MI ratios from locations with a 4-star or above rating
(countries with poor surveillance systems are classified as less than 4 stars)
on causes of death with HAQI as a covariate anchoring the lower bound of the
HAQI scale with a data point reported in the Bangalore study to predict age-sex
specific MI ratios for all locations and years. Then the age-sex-specific
incidence were estimated based on those predicted MI ratios. GBD used DisMod-MR
2.1 (Bayesian meta-regression tool) to generate consistent trends in all
parameters, and multiplied the outputs by the risk-weighted prevalence of LTBI
to get population-level estimates of incidence and prevalence. GBD disaggregated
the all-form TB outputs from DisMod-MR 2.1 into MDR-TB and XDR-TB by HIV status.
To do so, they estimated the proportions of TB cases with MDR-TB for all
locations and years, and then estimated the proportions of MDR-TB among
HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals based on the risk of MDR-TB associated
with HIV infection from a meta-analysis. To split MDR-TB into MDR-TB with and
without extensive drug resistance, GBD pooled the notification and survey data
on the proportion of MDR-TB cases with extensive drug resistance by
super-region, and applied these proportions to MDR-TB cases among HIV-negative
and HIV-positive individuals, respectively. [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1]_

Summary model description
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
It's a complex joint model that includes both tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. We
model TB and HIV together because HIV has impacts on both progression rate of
LTBI to active TB and active TB excess mortality rate. Note that we have
excluded the active TB drug resistance and GBD predicted the proportion of new
TB cases with MDR-TB or XDR-TB by ST-GPR. In our model, each simulant occupies
a state at each discrete time step. It is convenient to distinguish two
sub-state types: a healthy (susceptible) state and a disease (with condition)
state. Many simulants began the simulation in a susceptible state with, for
example, no TB and remain in the susceptible state until they contract LTBI,
progress to active TB, or die due to TB or other causes. Each state is mutually
exclusive (e.g. a simulant can be susceptible or be a prevalent case of TB, but
not both). However, a simulant may have TB and still be susceptible to HIV or
vice versa. Prevalence is the measure that describes the proportion of individuals
with disease in the total population during the given simulation time step. The
prevalence of a disease state determines what proportion of the population will
occupy that disease state during each time step. Each disease state has transition
attributes defining the simulant transitions into and out of the state. We
calculate transition probabilities from rates estimated in the GBD study and
external data sources as required. In addition, it is worth noting that this
model for CSU contracted project is not a dynamic transmission model. We will
not model infection passing between specific individuals in the simulation,
although the model is individual-based. In other words, individuals in the
simulation will, for example, move from uninfected to infected states, but the
model will not specify that individual X infected individual Y. As described
above, the model will be calibrated in aggregated level, the outputs from
simulation baseline scenario should match the population level rates estimated
in the GBD.
