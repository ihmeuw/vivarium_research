  decorator is encountered below. If you need an even deeper section level, just
  choose a new decorator symbol from the list here:

  And then add it to the list of decorators above.

Placeholder Intrapartum Sensors and Cesarean Section Module Document
=======================================================================

.. note::

  This page exists to hold in-progress notes from prior versions of documentation before this page is replaced with updated wave II documentation for implementation. 

  % of each facility type have cesarian section capabilities: At home (0%), in hospital(94%), in clinic/low-level facility (1%). [SARA (Ethiopia; filepath saved `on SharePoint <https://uwnetid.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ihme_simulation_science_team/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B63F98143-C6C3-4CF7-BF62-969344726A87%7D&file=ethiopia_data_received_notes.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true>`_.)].  We want these to be location specific, please code accordingly. These are placeholder values for now (extracted from the SARA Final Report, link in 'Source' column; the 'other' value is made-up), hopefully we will be able to find similar data available for Pakistan and Nigeria.   

  Relative risk of c-section on incidence of hemorrhage: 2.05 (1.84-2.29) [`Pubu et al 2021 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7887994/>`_ ]. This value is a stand-in from this population-based study in Tibet (see 'Source' column), in which the authors reported an odds ratio rather than a relative risk. With further research and analysis we will likely update this value. Outstanding items: how does c-section need overlap with hemorrhage/OL, what is the RR, how will we implement this with overlaps in total MD impact of facility type 

  % of those who receive intrapartum sensors that get identified as needing a c-section: TBD. Outstanding items: which facility types have intrapartum sensors? Is there anything else that an intrapartum sensor should influence (e.g. who receives ACS, can someone be identified as high risk from an intrapartum sensor and be moved to a higher level facility in time for birth)?

  Limitation: Only have one cohort, will not allow for downstream effects through pregnancies (c-sections likely to get another c-section in the future, losing a child might impact delivery facility, etc.)
