1.0 Overview
++++++++++++

This document is the page for the hemoglobin module of the pregnancy component
in the MNCNH Portfolio simulation.

This module will:

  1. Assign starting point hemoglobin exposure based on GBD

  2. Read-in necessary information from ANC module

  3. Modify hemoglobin exposure according to services received during pregnancy

  4. Output the following information:

    - Services received during pregnancy that relate to hemoglobin (for V&V, cost counting)

    - Hemoglobin exposure at the end of pregnancy for hemoglobin risk effect estimation (inputs to downstream models)

.. note::

  This module may have potential dependencies with the hypertension/pre-eclampsia model that have not yet been thought through. Model structure is subject to change in order to accomodate these dependencies.

2.0 Module Diagram and Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2.1 Module Diagram
----------------------

.. note::
  
  As discussed on the :ref:`maternal supplementation intervention document <oral_iron_antenatal>`, IFA and MMS have equivalent effects on hemoglobin. This diagram treats them as equivalent for this reason. However, we will need track which product was received as they have differences that will apply to other downstream modules of this simulation.

2.4 Module Action Points
---------------------------

.. list-table:: Hemoglobin module action point
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Action point
    - Description
    - Information
    - Note
  * - I
    - Assign hemoglobin exposure based on GBD
    - See :ref:`hemoglobin risk exposure document <2023_hemoglobin_exposure>`
    - Uses maternal age at end of pregnancy
  * - II
    - Calibrate to and remove effect of baseline IFA coverage
    - Effect size on hemoglobin and baseline coverage defined on :ref:`maternal supplementation intervention document <oral_iron_antenatal>`. We assume no one receives baseline IFA prior to their first ANC visit. Since we are initializing hemoglobin exposure at the start of pregnancy prior to anyone receiving IFA, we subtract the value of :code:`baseline_ifa_overall * ifa_hemoglobin_shift` from the hemoglobin exposure value of all simulants. Use the :code:`baseline_ifa_overall` parameter rather than :code:`baseline_ifa_at_anc`
    - The effect of baseline IFA will be added back in later in the decision tree when simulants receive it at their ANC visits. 
  * - III
    - Record hemoglobin exposure at the start of pregnancy

2.5: Python implementation summary
----------------------------------

The Python below shows possible implementation steps that are compatible with the diagram defined above. 

.. code-block:: python 

  # step 1: remove effect of baseline IFA from everyone
  hgb_start_of_pregnancy = gbd_hgb_exposure - ifa_effect_size * baseline_ifa_overall

  # step 2: apply first trimester oral iron effect
  hgb_after_first_trimester_anc = (
    hgb_start_of_pregnancy + ifa_effect_size
    if (anc_attendance in ['first_trimester_only', 'later_pregnancy_and_first_trimester'])
      and oral_iron_covered
    else
    hgb_start_of_pregnancy
  )

  # step 3: assess IV iron coverage based on hgb_after_first_trimester_anc exposure and other attributes

  # anemia screening: see anemia screening page for documentation
  # note that we use hgb_after_first_trimester_anc for this
  actual_low_hemoglobin = hgb_after_first_trimester_anc < 100
  probability_test_low_hemoglobin = (
    HEMOGLOBIN_SCREENING_SENSITIVITY
    if actual_low_hemoglobin
    else
    1 - HEMOGLOBIN_SCREENING_SPECIFICITY
  )
  test_low_hemoglobin = np.random.choice(
    [True, False],
    p=[probability_test_low_hemoglobin, 1 - probability_test_low_hemoglobin]
  )
  # end anemia screening

  received_iv_iron = (
    anc_attendance in ['later_pregnancy_only', 'first_trimester_and_later_pregnancy']
      and hemoglobin_screen_covered 
      and test_low_hemoglobin
      and low_ferritin_exposure 
      and iv_iron_covered
  )

  # step 4: apply later pregnancy ANC oral iron effects effects
  hgb_at_after_later_pregnancy = hgb_after_first_trimester_anc + (
    ifa_effect_size
    if (anc_attendance == 'later_pregnancy_only')
      and oral_iron_covered
      and not received_iv_iron
    else
    0
  )

  # step 5: apply IV iron effect size
  hgb_at_birth = hgb_at_after_later_pregnancy + (
    iv_iron_effect_size
    if received_iv_iron
    else
    0
  )

3.0 Assumptions and limitations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- We assume there are no changes in natural history hemoglobin trajectory throughout pregnancy,
  including when a pregnancy spans GBD age groups (we use the age group at the *end* of pregnancy to determine hemoglobin).

- We assume immediate effect of oral and IV iron interventions on hemoglobin from intervention receipt.

- We assume complete adherence of oral iron intervention.

- We assume no additional effect of oral iron supplementation when taken following IV iron administration

- We use the fraction of iron responsive anemia among total anemia as a proxy for low ferritin given low hemoglobin. This may underestimate the population eligible for IV iron by not considering the iron non responsive anemias that have low ferritin. Note that this may be improved upon by updating to PRISMA data.

- We assume the IV iron intervention (+23 g/L) to have a greater effect than GBD 2023's implied effect of IV iron used in the estimation of their iron deficiency models, +14.3 g/L(95% UI: 3.58 -25.59). Notably, our assumed effect is within the uncertainty interval of GBD's assumed effect size and the value we assume is specific to the pregnant population (whereas GBD's value is not).

4.0 Verification and Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Baseline simulated hemoglobin distribution (mean and standard deviation) should match the GBD 2023 hemoglobin risk exposure distribution

- Hemoglobin at the start of pregnancy and end of pregnancy should vary in accordance with intervention receipts

- Intervention coverage should match expected values

- IFA/MMS should have expected effect on hemoglobin

- At the individual level, only simulants who attend ANC should receive interventions

- Check that IV iron only given to those with measured low hemoglobin and low ferritin
- Check that IV iron has the intended effect on hemoglobin when given 

- Check that measured and true hemoglobin exposures vary by the expected degree

- Check that low ferritin values match expectations (specific to anemia status)
