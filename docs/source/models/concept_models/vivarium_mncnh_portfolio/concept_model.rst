1.0 Overview
++++++++++++

This document is the overall page for the Maternal, Newborn, and Child Nutrition and Health (MNCNH) Portfolio simulation and
contains information that relates to all modeled subcomponents included in 
the simulation.

.. _mncnh_portfolio_2.0:

2.0 Modeling aims and objectives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The MNCNH Portfolio simulation builds on work our team has done in other simulations
of pregnancy and early childhood.
The most recent was the :ref:`Nutrition Optimization (NO) <2021_concept_model_vivarium_nutrition_optimization>` simulation,
which (as the name suggests) focused particularly on nutrition interventions.
That simulation allowed us to estimate the impacts of each intervention, and crucially also
how the interventions might *interact*, for example due to prevention
reducing the need for treatment down the line.
"Optimization" refers to the fact that we used the output of the NO sim to calculate
*optimal* allocation of money to have the biggest impact given a budget,
taking all these interactions into account.

Nutrition interventions continue to be included in the MNCNH portfolio sim, but the "portfolio" is
broader; the intervention space includes more products.
These products, like the nutrition interventions in the NO project,
interact in complex ways, and an aim of this simulation is to estimate the impact
of different *combinations* of these interventions.
As before, we also plan to estimate costs and calculate optimal budget allocation,
possibly with improved costing methodology.
This page serves as documentation for the simulation part of the project, which is focused
on estimating burden under a variety of scenarios designed to surface all the relevant product interactions.

Simulating more interventions means simulating more risks and causes for those interventions
to act on, simulating more details of the healthcare system to model how those interventions
would be delivered, and including more detail in the intrapartum (labor and delivery) and neonatal time periods.

We plan to complete this work in 3 waves. 

* Wave 1 will include the basic model design, outlines of the healthcare system, and some interventions (AI ultrasound, RDS management).
* Wave 2 will add in some antenatal supplements (MMS, IV iron), the hemoglobin risk for birthing parents, all downstream causes affected by hemoglobin, and higher level delivery facility interventions.
* Wave 3 will add in gestational blood pressure and relevant causes and risks including pre-eclampsia care and downstream effects of high blood pressure.

As of August 2025, Wave 1 is mostly complete in both documentation and implementation, and Wave 2 is partially documented and has just started implementation.

.. _mncnh_portfolio_3.0:

3.0 Concept model diagram and submodels
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As in the NO simulation, rather than simulate an entire population of all ages and sexes,
this simulation includes only pregnant people and the neonates they give birth to.
We start the simulation with a cohort of simulants all at the beginning of pregnancy, and move
them in lockstep through their pregnancies.
For those pregnancies that result in a live birth, we then simulate a neonate (we do not model twins)
through the first month of life.
In this way, our simulation represents all the people who may benefit from the interventions of interest,
without wasting computational resources on simulating irrelevant people, such as adult males.
We call the potential simulant pair we follow through the simulation (pregnant person and neonate) a
"simulant dyad."

This model is different than NO and other simulations we've done in that it follows a decision-tree-like
format in which we jump directly to from one decision point to the next rather than taking equal-sized steps
through time.
For this reason, throughout this model we calculate and express events in terms of probabilities,
rather than rates per person-time or similar.

The overall simulation model is divided into four "components," which are differentiated by the timespan
and the simulant that they model.

* The :ref:`Pregnancy component <mncnh_portfolio_pregnancy_component>`, which models
  from the beginning of pregnancy until the start of labor.
* The :ref:`Intrapartum component <mncnh_portfolio_intrapartum_component>`, which models
  labor and delivery, including delivery complications.
* The :ref:`Neonatal component <mncnh_portfolio_neonatal_component>`, which models the
  first month of life for newborns.
* The :ref:`Postpartum component <mncnh_portfolio_postpartum_component>`, which models the
  six weeks after the end of pregnancy for the pregnant person.

.. warning::

  When we say "component" here, we mean something distinct from a
  :ref:`Vivarium component <vivarium:components_concept>`.

Graphically, the component breakdown looks like this:

.. image:: component_overview_diagram.drawio.png

.. note::

  Do not interpret the x-axis in this diagram as time, since e.g. the duration of pregnancy is not at all
  constant.
  Also, if misinterpreted this way, the x-axis would be wildly not to scale.

However, the only situation in which all components are actually reached for a given simulant
dyad is the case in which the pregnancy results in a live birth and the birthing person survives
childbirth.
In other situations, some components will not be reached.
The rules by which components flow into other components are as follows:

* All simulant dyads start at the pregnancy component.
* If the birth outcome from the pregnancy component is a live or stillbirth (NOT abortion/miscarriage/ectopic pregnancy), proceed to the intrapartum component.
  Otherwise, skip to the postpartum component.
* At the end of the intrapartum component, if the birth outcome from the pregnancy component is a live birth,
  proceed to the neonatal component.
  Otherwise, if the birth parent survives childbirth, proceed to the postpartum component.
* At the end of the neonatal component, if the birth parent survived childbirth in the intrapartum component,
  proceed to the postpartum component.

Here is a graphic representation of the same information:

.. image:: component_flow_diagram.drawio.png

Each component is further subdivided into "modules,"
which are organized by topic (rather than by time/simulant as in the components).
Each module may have some simulant dyad attributes as input (values it needs)
and some simulant dyad attributes as output (values it initializes).
Module outputs may be 
used as inputs to other modules and/or serve as information for verification and 
validation and/or simulation results.
For clarity, in the tables below we will write the modules in an order that satisfies the following property:
each variable is defined as a module output prior to being 
used as a module input.
This helps us make sure we aren't creating any cyclic dependencies.
Technically, any order satisfying this property is an equivalent, valid order in which
the modules could be run in the simulation.

.. note::

  There is :ref:`a template <2024_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio_module_template>` to use when creating new module pages.

..
  The below toctree, which used to be rendered (not :hidden:), shows all the modules in a flat list in alphabetical order.
  This didn't seem to add much beyond the tables below, and in fact was kind of confusing since all the components'
  modules were listed together and interspersed.

Intrapartum component
---------------------

.. note::

  Only live births or stillbirths (NOT abortions/miscarriages/ectopic pregnancies) will proceed to the intrapartum component,
  as described above.

.. warning::

  As currently designed, the intrapartum component models an intervention for misoprostol to 
  prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in home birth settings only. We do not consider any
  interventions for PPH prevention at facility settings nor do we model the expected greater
  incidence of PPH in home settings relative to facility settings. 

  Therefore, as written, the incidence of PPH by delivery setting will be miscalibrated to
  the expectation in reality. We plan to continue with the implementing the model as written while
  noting this limitation until we implement a strategy to address this (`see related 
  ticket here <https://jira.ihme.washington.edu/browse/SSCI-2310>`_)

  Scenarios were reworked for model version 18.4. To see the definition of scenarios used for prior models, see the record in `this pull request <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1811>`__. Note that scenario design for this simulation is expected to undergo an additional future rework to achieve compatibility with an "emulator" design.

4.0 Outputs/Observers
++++++++++++++++++++++

Specific observer outputs and their stratifications may vary by model run as needs change. Modifications to default will be noted in the model run requests tables. Note that the observers and outputs listed here are different from the module outputs above. The outputs of the module are intended to be intermediate values that may or may not be included as observed simulated outputs.

Default stratifications to all observers should include scenario and input draw.

.. note::
  
  Observers cannot support more than 15 stratifications. Design of simulation observers should take this into account.

    - The standard number of draws available for most of our model input parameters is 500 for GBD 2021 and 250 for GBD 2023. There are a few instances where our input data have different numbers of draws available. Those instances are summarized in the table following this one. To account for the varying number of draws available for our input data, we will pre-specify which draws to select according to the numbers listed here. 20 draws have been listed although the default number of draws for V&V model runs is 10 - the first 10 numbers in this list should be used for V&V runs. 

      This list of numbers was first generated for GBD 2021 data starting in model 11.0 by sampling a random number between 0 and 499 and resampling when a number was generated that had the same remainder after dividing by 100 or 250 as a number that was already in the list. This strategy ensures that we do not run multiple draws that have identical data for any parameter in our model. These draws included: [115, 60, 368, 197, 79, 244, 272, 167, 146, 71, 278, 406, 94, 420, 109, 26, 35, 114, 428, 218]. The final number in the list (218) was updated from (170) in September of 2025 to account for new input data with 250 draws.

      This list was later updated for GBD 2023 data starting in model 19.0 by taking the remainder of each number in the GBD 2021 list after dividing by 250 and re-sampling a new value for 218 (which had a duplicate value % 100 as another number in the list).

  * - Randomness key columns
    - ['entrance_time','age']
    - Note that each row of the population table in this simulation contains a pregnant simulant AND the outcome of that simulant's pregnancy. Therefore, the conversion of a stillbirth to a live birth between simulated scenarios in this simulation will not result in a new row added to the simulation state table and therefore will not change the state table index value of other simulants like occured in the IV iron simulation and resulted in disruptions to common random numbers between scenarios. Therefore, these randomness key columns are expected to be sufficient for this simulation.

        previously some were being assigned to the stillbirth "age group".

    - Everything is validating - RR on sepsis aligns with expected value; other causes, non-RDS preterm, and encephalopathy all have the expected RRs of 1 from antibiotics.
      There's an RR of 0.78 for antibiotics on preterm with RDS, but we confirmed that when we group this by facility type, there is the expected RR of 1. This is because
      the probability of a simulant receiving CPAP and the probability of receiving antibiotics are not independent (both related to facility choice).

        For these checks, "verify" means we are comparing the simulation
        output to a value that was input directly (e.g., the LBWSG
        distribution), whereas "validate" means we are expecting the sim
        to indirectly reproduce a value that was not input directly
        (e.g., matching GBD's IFD proportion by using the specified
        causal probabilities for facility choice)

      Note 2
        The calculation of several of the validation targets requires
        running Nathaniel's facility choice nanosim or its
        data-processing code. The necessary validation targets are
        computed in the `facility choice validation targets notebook`_
        and are saved in the `facility choice validation targets .csv
        file`_

      * Validate rates of preterm birth given in-facility status against
        optimization targets (calculated in `facility choice validation
        targets notebook`_)
      * Validate rates of in-facility delivery given ANC status against
        optimization targets (calculated in `facility choice validation
        targets notebook`_)
      * Validate rates of in-facility delivery against GBD covariate 51

        GBD preterm rates calculated from LBWSG data

        either the "live births by sex" covariate 1106, or
        get_population with the "Birth" age group 164)

        baseline coverage from :ref:`AI Ultrasound module

      * Validate P( believed preterm | preterm status, ultrasound type )

      Note 3
        The following checks in the interactive sim are probably only
        necessary if some of the above checks are failing, although it
        might be a good idea to do at least the first two (LBWSG
        distribution and GA error distribution) since these components
        are getting modified for this model run

      * Verify sex-specific LBWSG distribution against GBD
      * Verify that the distribution of gestational age estimation
        errors, stratified by ultrasound type, matches the normal
        distributions specified in the :ref:`AI Ultrasound module

  * - `Ferritin exposure model needs updating <https://jira.ihme.washington.edu/browse/SSCI-2439>`__
    - Ali's documentation issue resulted in known issues with ferritin data used for implementation of anemia screening model
    - Either update to strategy outlined `in this PR <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1810>`__ or an alternative strategy using PRISMA data shared by the Gates foundation
    - Will decide how to proceed when we receive PRISMA data
  * - `Peripartum depression model needs updating <https://jira.ihme.washington.edu/browse/SSCI-2415>`__
    - Current implementation is based off of an adaptation of the assumptions used in the GBD 2021 major depressive disorders cause model
    - We will need to either (1) update our model to be in line with the GBD 2023 model and consider updating our PAF calculation strategy as described in this ticket, or (2) update to the extra-GBD data on peripartum depression obtained from the mental disorders modelers
    - Will decide how to proceed after discussing with the mental disorders modelers 
  * - Miscalibration of maternal sepsis incidence rates, particularly for Nigeria
    - Thought to be due to using the fatal PAF from GBD applied to incidence and/or the location-aggregated PAF for our modeled locations which are not most detailed locations
    - Update to custom-calculated PAF and reassess
    - TBD
  * - Late neonatal mortality due to preterm birth slightly underestimated and other-causes mortality may be slightly overestimated (though within 10%)
    - Unknown -- possibly related to negative other causes mortality in Pakistan and Nigeria.
    - Zeb to request an observer for negative other causes mortality
    - Model 20.0
  * - Scenario with increased ultrasound coverage leads to (very slightly) lower IFD
    - Does not appear to be an implementation bug (all facility choice model V&V criteria are met), but is not the expected result
    - Ali to investigate the rates of false positive and false negatives by scenario to determine if ultrasound improvements is reducing false positives among term babies more than it is reducing false negatives among preterm babies, which could explain this result
    - Tabled for now. `See ticket here <https://jira.ihme.washington.edu/browse/SSCI-2409>`_
  * - Late neonatal mortality due to preterm birth with RDS slightly (~2%) underestimated
    - The PAF of ACS and CPAP on preterm birth with RDS CSMRisk is calculated with delivery facility proportions at birth, not at 7 days
    - Accept this limitation, until/unless there are other reasons to revamp PAF calculation, since this would require many components not currently present in PAF sim
    - N/A
  * - Early neonatal mortality due to preterm birth with RDS slightly (~1.5%) overestimated and
      late neonatal mortality slightly (~0.75%) underestimated across all causes
    - The PAF of ACS and CPAP on preterm birth with RDS CSMRisk is calculated without accounting for
      correlation between LBWSG and CPAP/ACS, which is induced by the facility choice model.
      The miscalibration in ENN causes miscalibration of LBWSG exposure for LNN.
    - Accept these limitations, until/unless there are other reasons to revamp PAF calculation,
      since this would require many components not currently present in PAF sim.
      Note that the LNN limitation stacks with the previous limitation for preterm birth with RDS to result in
      a nearly 3% underestimate in that LNN CSMRisk.
    - N/A
  * - In model 2: Found an error in GBD 2021 for Pakistan fistula modeling - need to come back in a future V&V run after we update the Pakistan OL prevalence values from GBD 2021 to GBD 2023. 
    - 
    - Revisit following GBD 2023 update
    - On hold until GBD 2023 update

6.0 Limitations
+++++++++++++++

* Unclear if we will be able to include upstream factors, but these are likely correlated with many things such as ANC visit rate, care available, or even outcome rates 

* We currently do not consider the potential impact of pregnancy outcome, mode of delivery, or preterm status on postpartum depression incidence (although we do model the impact of hemoglobin on PPD incidence). This may cause us to underestimate the impact of interventions that work through these mechanisms on postpartum depression burden. 

* Factors such as birth asphyxia have been shown to predisopose infants to infection which can result in sepsis [Tikmani-et-al-2016]_. We do not model a relationship between birth asphyxia and sepsis, so we do not capture any indirect effects of interventions to reduce birth asphyxia (like cesarean sections) on sepsis as mediated through reductions in birth asphyxia. 

* We assume that all maternal deaths occur at the conclusion of the intrapartum period and prior to the start of the postpartum period. Therefore, we assume it is not possible for any simulants who die of a maternal disorder to experience postpartum YLDs (such as those due to postpartum depression and/or postpartum anemia). However, this may be possible in reality, particularly for those who die of "late maternal deaths."

* We track certain outcomes among abortion/miscarriage/ectopic pregnancies in this model, including first trimester ANC attendance and associated interventions, anemia YLDs, and postpartum depression. However, these pregnancies are not given special consideration other than their premature end and we do not consider how this population may differ from pregnancies that end in live or still births in terms of their ANC attendance rates or other attributes beyond maternal disorders burden. Additionally, we do not model any variation in these attributes by subtype (abortion vs. miscarriage vs. ectopic pregnancy), despite there being expected differences in behavior between these groups.

* We do not model an underlying correlation between hemoglobin exposure and stillbirth rates, despite evidence that such an association exists. Therefore, our IV iron intervention model, which is targeted to those with low hemoglobin, will be misaligned with respect to the stillbirth rate among the IV iron intervention target population.
  
  * We could use the GBD risk effects between hemoglobin and stillbirth to model baseline correlation only and not model updates in stillbirth rates in response to changes in hemoglobin exposure to address this limitation (as these effects are captured in the impact of the hemoglobin-affecting interventions IV Iron and IFA/MMS already). However, this model upgrade is not highest priority. `See this backlog JIRA ticket #2343 <https://jira.ihme.washington.edu/browse/SSCI-2343>`_

* [Finkelstein-et-al-2024]_ primarily includes RCTs from high-income countries, so the effect size for IFA on maternal hemoglobin may be overestimated for Sub-Saharan African countries (including Ethiopia and Nigeria) with typically higher rates of non-iron deficiency anemias.

* We do not currently model an oral iron treatment intervention, despite the recommendation by WHO to treat all pregnancies with IFA and all anemic pregnancies with oral iron treatment (essentially a higher dosage of iron than IFA).
  We have a `JIRA ticket <https://jira.ihme.washington.edu/browse/SSCI-2376>`_ to add this intervention in the future, but it is not currently prioritized. 
  There are some individuals who receive oral iron treatment at baseline and we want to model the replacement of that oral iron treatment with IV iron treatment. 
  However, we are not subtracting out the effect of oral iron treatment prior to modeling the scale up of IV iron treatment. This will result in the following limitations:
  
    * For individuals who received oral iron treatment at baseline and still remain eligible for IV iron following their oral iron treatment: we will double count the impact of the interventions, thus overestimating the potential scale-up of IV iron.
    * For individuals who received oral iron treatment at baseline and no longer remain eligible for IV iron following their oral iron treatment: there will be essentially no difference in impact for this population given that IV and oral iron treatment have basically equal impacts, however, we will be underestimating the size of the population requiring treatment and therefore underestimating the cost required to achieve the health outcomes seen in these scenarios.
