1.0 Overview
++++++++++++

This document is the overall page for the MNCNH Portfolio simulation and 
contains information that relates to all modeled subcomponents included in 
the simulation.

.. _mncnh_portfolio_2.0:

2.0 Modeling aims and objectives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Objective:** Expand on prior MNCH simulation work to be able to include 
all MNCNH portfolio products. Compare health gains and costs for each 
intervention set and help in determining prioritization. Expand the capabilities of 
the simulation to include more risks and causes, more details on healthcare systems, 
and details on the intrapartum and neonatal time periods.

.. note::

  This concept model diagram was reorganized in April 2025 after much of wave I had been implemented. A record of the PRs for this reorganization are listed below:

  * Pregnancy component reorganization: `https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1615 <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1615>`_
  * Intrapartum component reorganization: `https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1617 <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1617>`_
  * Neonatal component reorganization: `https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1619 <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1619>`_


We plan to complete this work in 3 waves. 

* Wave 1 will include the basic model design, outlines of the healthcare system, and some interventions (AI ultrasound, higher level delivery facility interventions, RDS management). 
* Wave 2 will add in some antenatal supplements (MMS, IV iron), the hemoglobin risk for birthing parents, and all downstream causes affected by hemoglobin. 
* Wave 3 will add in gestational blood pressure and relevant causes and risks including pre-eclampsia care and downstream effects of high blood pressure. 

The model is further subdivided into three components:

1. Pregnancy component
2. Intrapartum component
3. Neonatal component

Each component will consist of several modules, which will convert certain module 
inputs to module outputs via decision tree-based instructions. Module outputs may be 
used as inputs to other modules and/or serve as information for verification and 
validation and/or simulation results.

The following tables link to each simulation module and provide a summary of module 
input and output variables. Notably, the ordering of modules in the table is 
significant: the order of operations for implementation moves from top to bottom. 
Specically, each variable must be defined as a module output in a row prior to being 
defined as a module input in a subsequent row.

    - Everything is validating - RR on sepsis aligns with expected value; other causes, non-RDS preterm, and encephalopathy all have the expected RRs of 1 from antibiotics.
      There's an RR of 0.78 for antibiotics on preterm with RDS, but we confirmed that when we group this by facility type, there is the expected RR of 1. This is because
      the probability of a simulant receiving CPAP and the probability of receiving antibiotics are not independent (both related to facility choice).

  * - 6.1
    - Check ENN mortality ratio compared to GBD
    - Neonatal mortality ratios are now slightly underestimated (rather than the previous overestimation). Note that calculation of the mortality ratio of the LNN age group has been updated in this notebook to be [deaths in LNN age group] / [population at the start of the LNN age group], rather than a denominator of live births so that LNN mortality is not dependent on ENN mortality.

  * - 6.2
    - Check ENN mortality ratio compared to GBD
    - Neonatal mortality ratios are now dramatically overestimated. Note that while the birth observer has changed between models 6.1 and 6.2, it has been verified that birth counts do not vary between these runs and that greater death count values are driving the difference between neonatal mortality ratios in 6.1 and 6.2

  Some of the notebook URLs for the older runs might be out-of-date. If you click one of these links and it gives
  you a 404 error, add to your URL `/old_vnv_notebooks/` after `verification_and_validation`, and that should take you
  to the right place!

  * - Issue
    - Explanation
    - Action plan
    - Timeline
  * - Unexpectedly high neonatal death counts in model 6.2
    - Unknown - want to confirm this is a true result and not some bug
    - Research and engineering to investigate code changes between model 6.1 and 6.2
    - Before running model 6.3 and 6.4
  * - Issues with neonatal mortality ratio V&V
    - Under investigation. Unknown if model will meet verification criteria for neonatal mortality ratio (deaths per birth in ENN age group) that has been used as a verification target (and that has been met for model 6.1, but not prior) will simultaneously meet verification target for neonatal mortality rate (deaths per person time spent in age group). Also unknown if rate to probability calculation will impact findings.
    - Run model with differing rate to probability calculations, document changes required to add a person-time observer so we can check neonatal mortality rate verification target
