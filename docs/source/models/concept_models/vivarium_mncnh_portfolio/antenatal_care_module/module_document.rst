Antenatal care attendance module
======================================

  :depth: 2

1.0 Overview
++++++++++++

This module determines a simulant's antenatal care attendance exposure according to their ANC visit 
propensity value and the distribution of ANC attendance exposure categories specific to their location and pregnancy term length. ANC attendance exposure categories include whether a simulant attends an ANC visit during their first trimester and/or later during their pregnancy. 

ANC visit timing is particularly relevant to both the hemoglobin and facility choice components of this simulation, so for more information 
on how outputs from this module will be used, refer to :ref:`our hemoglobin module documentation <2024_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio_hemoglobin_module>`
and :ref:`our facility choice module documentation <2024_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio_facility_choice_module>`.

  * - Input
    - Source module
    - Application
    - Note
  * - Pregnancy term length
    - :ref:`Pregnancy I module <2024_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio_pregnancy_module>`
    - Determines which set of probabilities to use for the ANC exposure categories. 
    - Full term pregnancies can be assigned any of the values A, B, C, or D, 
      whereas we assume partial term pregnancies can only attend ANC in the first trimester, so only categories B and D have nonzero probability. 
      See exposure probability tables below.
  * - ANC propensity
    - :ref:`Initial attributes module <2024_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio_initial_attributes_module>`
    - Use the ANC propensity together with the ANC attendance exposure probabilities below 
      to select one of the ANC exposure categories A, B, C, or D, as described in the :ref:`special ordering of the categories <facility_choice_special_ordering_of_categories_section>` 
      section of the facility choice model document. When sampling, the categories should be ordered D < C < B < A (highest risk to lowest risk in terms of ultrasound timing), so that higher propensity values correspond to seeking more ANC care.
    - ANC propensity is correlated with LBWSG category propensity and IFD propensity as described in the the :ref:`correlated propensities <facility_choice_correlated_propensities_section>` 
      section of the facility choice model document. Currently we assume that there is no correlation of ANC with other factors.

2.2 Module Description 
----------------------

ANC attendance will be modeled as a single variable with 4 possible exposure options:

A. Attends ANC during first trimester AND later pregnancy
B. Attends ANC during first trimester but NOT later pregnancy
C. Attends ANC during later pregnancy but NOT first trimester
D. Does not attend ANC at all during pregnancy

.. list-table:: ANC exposure options
  :header-rows: 1

  * - 
    - Visit during late pregnancy
    - No visit during late pregnancy
  * - **Visit during first trimester**
    - A
    - B
  * - **No visit during first trimester**
    - C
    - D

The below table describes what probability values to use for each exposure option outlined above, **for full term pregnancies**.

  * - ANC exposure option
    - Description
    - Probability value
    - Notes
  * - A
    - Attends ANC during first trimester AND later pregnancy
    - ``min(ANCfirst, ANC4)``
    - Assume that attending ANC in first trimester reflects "active care seeking behavior" and that it is unlikely
      for someone who attends first trimester ANC to attend no subsequent visits. 
  * - B
    - Attends ANC during first trimester but NOT later pregnancy
    - ``ANCfirst - min(ANCfirst, ANC4)``
    - Prevalence of first trimester visit ONLY (and no late pregnancy visit) only occurs if ANCfirst > ANC4
  * - C
    - Attends ANC during later pregnancy but NOT first trimester
    - ``ANC1 - ANCfirst``
    - 
  * - D
    - Does not attend ANC at all during pregnancy
    - ``1 - ANC1``  
    - 

.. note:: 

    As of `pull request #1690 <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1690>`_ we updated how we assign our ANC exposures to 
    include the ANCfirst variable that the HS team processed and shared with us. Please see `these slides <https://uwnetid.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ihme_simulation_science_team/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BADD6223E-9FCA-40BB-BB7F-FE44F377CCDB%7D&file=ANC%20visit%20timing%20data%20strategy%20options.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true>`_ 
    for more information on this strategy update.

The above probabilities are to be implemented for full term pregnancies only. Partial term pregnancies are assigned 
probabilities differently because we assume their pregnancies end before they can attend later pregnancy ANC visits. 
The below table describes what probabilities to use for each exposure option **for partial term pregnancies**:

2.3 Module Outputs
------------------

As mentioned earlier, ANC attendance impacts hemoglobin exposure and facility choice in our model, and in order for the 
outputs of this component to be compatible with the data needs of these two downstream components, we will need two different
outputs, one being dichotomous for the hemoglobin component and the other being polychotomous for the facility choice component.  

.. list-table:: Module outputs
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 10 15 15

  * - Output
    - Value
    - Note
  * - Attends ANC in first trimester?
    - 
      - *True*  for groups A and B 
      - *False* for groups C and D
    - This output will be used as an input for the :ref:`hemoglobin module <2024_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio_hemoglobin_module>`.
      This variable is dichotomous for each pregnancy.
  * - Attends ANC in later pregnancy?
    - 
      - *True*  for groups A and C 
      - *False* for groups B and D
    - This output will be used as an input for the :ref:`hemoglobin module <2024_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio_hemoglobin_module>`.
      This variable is dichotomous for each pregnancy.
  * - ANC attendance 
    - 
      1. No ANC
      2. ANC in later pregnancy only
      3. ANC in 1st trimester only
      4. ANC in 1st trimester and later pregnancy
    - This output will be used as an input for the :ref:`facility choice module <2024_vivarium_mncnh_portfolio_facility_choice_module>`.
      The variable is polytomous for each pregnancy with the above 4 categories (ordered from worst to best). These are the same four categories listed above as A-D, 
      but in reverse order, i.e., 1 = D, 2 = C, 3 = B, 4 = A. These need to be ordered D < C < B < A when sampling the variable using the correlated propensity for 
      the facility choice model.


3.0 Assumptions and limitations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* We assume that partial term pregnancies have the same probability of ANC coverage as full term pregnancies and assume that these visits occur exclusively 
  during the first trimester given that these pregnancies do not progress late into pregnancy. Note that in effect this makes first trimester ANC attendance 
  rate higher among partial term pregnancies than full term pregnancies, which is not necessarily logical. We accept this as a limitation given that the 
  interventions partial term pregnancies can receive at a first trimester visit (MMS, AI ultrasound) primarily affect outcomes that do not apply to partial 
  term pregnancies (MMS->stillbirth, MMS->LBWSG, MMS->hemoglobin->sepsis/obstructed labor, and ultrasound/facility delivery). However, it is possible that 
  we will overestimate the impact of MMS->hemoglobin on anemia YLDs and depressive disorders among partial term pregnancies as a result of this assumption.

  - Note that the data on ANC attendance in DHS is collected on live and still births (full term pregnancies) only.
  - We assume that no partial term pregnancies attend ANC visits after the first trimester. However, as partial term pregnancies may last as long as 24 weeks according to our pregnancy model, it is possible that some may.

* We assume that the prevalence of attending both first trimester and later pregnancy visits is the minimum of ANCfirst (as processed by the HS team) and ANC4 
  (GBD covariate also processed by HS team). There is non-zero prevalence of first trimester visits only when ANC4 > ANC1 (such as in Pakistan). We are likely
  overestimating the correlation between first trimester ANC and later pregnancy ANC (i.e., the prevalence of a first trimester ANC visit ONLY is likely non-zero 
  despite this assertion in our model.) 

.. todo:: 

  If we decide to improve the estimation of timing for ANC visits in our model (see `this JIRA ticket <https://jira.ihme.washington.edu/browse/SSCI-2318>`) we need to
  update our documentation accordingly.

4.0 Verification and Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Overall ANC attendance should match expected ANC1 values among the overall population as well as stratified by pregnancy term length
* Confirm no later pregnancy ANC attendance among partial term pregnancies
* Confirm first trimester ANC and later pregnancy ANC attendance rate among full term pregnancies is equal to minimum of ANCfirst and ANC4
* Confirm first trimester ONLY ANC attendance rate among full term pregnancies is equal to ANCfirst - min(ANCfirst, ANC4)
* Confirm later pregnancy ONLY ANC attendance rate among full term pregnancies is equal to ANC1 - ANCfirst
