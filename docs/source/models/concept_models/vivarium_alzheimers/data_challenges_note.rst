1.0 Overview
++++++++++++

This document outlines key data challenges identified for the Alzheimer's disease early detection simulation, with particular focus on two novel modeling requirements: (1) stage-specific cost profiles and (2) existing AD testing pathway modeling.

2.0 Stage-Specific Cost Modeling Challenge
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2.1 The Data Challenge
-----------------------

**Novel Requirement:** The model requires cost estimates for each of the 6 disease states, including preclinical Alzheimer's disease - a population that is largely undiagnosed and unstudied from a cost perspective.

**Why This is Challenging:**
- **Preclinical AD costs:** Essentially no existing data since this population is undiagnosed in current practice
- **Stage-specific granularity:** Most cost-of-illness studies focus on "mild," "moderate," "severe" dementia without fine-grained state definitions
- **Healthcare utilization variation:** Costs vary dramatically by diagnosis status, location, and healthcare system
- **Informal care integration:** Need to capture the 5:1 ratio of total:medical costs (per Lastuka et al. research)

2.2 Proposed Data Strategy
--------------------------

**Preclinical AD Cost Assumptions:**
- **Conservative approach:** Assume minimal excess costs above background population
- **Medical costs:** Standard age-appropriate healthcare utilization
- **Informal care:** Zero excess informal care (cognitively normal)
- **Monitoring costs:** Small additional cost for those who receive BBBM+ diagnosis

**MCI and Dementia Stage Costs:**
- **Literature synthesis:** Cost-of-illness studies by severity level
- **Location-specific adjustment:** Healthcare system and wage differences
- **Informal care scaling:** Apply 5:1 total:medical cost ratio from Lastuka methodology
- **Progression-based interpolation:** Smooth cost increases between documented stages

**Data Sources to Pursue:**
- ICER cost-effectiveness studies (2023) for benchmarking
- Alzheimer's Association cost reports by severity
- Medicare claims analysis for diagnosed AD patients
- International cost studies for location-specific parameters
- Caregiver burden surveys for informal care quantification

2.3 Research Priorities
-----------------------

**High Priority:**
1. **Preclinical cost assumptions validation** - Expert consultation on minimal excess cost assumption
2. **Stage-specific cost interpolation** - Methodology for smooth cost progression curves
3. **Location-specific cost scaling** - PPP adjustment and healthcare system differences

**Medium Priority:**
1. Caregiver burden variation by disease stage
2. Healthcare utilization patterns by diagnosis status
3. Social services and community support cost components

3.0 Existing AD Testing Pathway Challenge
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3.1 The Data Challenge  
-----------------------

**Missing Component:** Current model framework lacks detailed modeling of existing AD diagnostic pathways (CSF biomarkers, PET imaging, clinical assessment), which is critical for:
- **Alternative Scenario 1 value proposition:** Quantifying expensive test avoidance with BBBM
- **Reference scenario realism:** Accurate baseline diagnostic timing and costs
- **Healthcare system impact:** Understanding current vs. alternative testing burden

**Why This is Challenging:**
- **Pathway complexity:** Multiple diagnostic routes with different triggers and timings
- **Healthcare system variation:** Dramatic differences in access and utilization by location
- **Cost heterogeneity:** CSF (~$1,500) vs. PET (~$5,000) vs. clinical assessment costs
- **Timing uncertainty:** Symptom onset to diagnosis delays vary widely

3.2 Proposed Data Strategy
--------------------------

**Testing Pathway Framework:**
- **Symptomatic triggers:** Model cognitive symptom thresholds for testing initiation
- **Healthcare access:** Location-specific testing availability and utilization rates
- **Sequential testing:** Clinical assessment â†’ biomarker confirmation patterns
- **Diagnostic timing:** Age at diagnosis distributions by location and testing pathway

**Cost Framework:**
- **Direct testing costs:** CSF biomarker, PET imaging, clinical assessment fees
- **Healthcare utilization:** Specialist visits, repeat testing, follow-up care
- **Time costs:** Patient and caregiver time for testing procedures
- **Geographic variation:** Healthcare system differences in cost and access

**Data Sources to Pursue:**
- Medicare claims analysis for AD diagnostic codes and procedures
- Healthcare utilization surveys in target countries
- Clinical practice guidelines for AD diagnosis timing
- International Alzheimer's disease registry data
- Healthcare economic evaluations of diagnostic pathways

3.3 Implementation Strategy
---------------------------

**Simplified Approach (Phase 1):**
- **Binary testing status:** Tested vs. untested in reference scenario
- **Average testing costs:** Blended cost of current diagnostic pathways
- **Standard timing:** Literature-based age at diagnosis distributions
- **Location scaling:** Healthcare cost indices for international adaptation

**Enhanced Approach (Phase 2):**
- **Multiple testing pathways:** CSF vs. PET vs. clinical-only routes
- **Sequential testing decisions:** Risk-stratified diagnostic algorithms  
- **Dynamic timing:** Healthcare seeking behavior and access modeling
- **Capacity constraints:** Testing availability and waiting time effects
