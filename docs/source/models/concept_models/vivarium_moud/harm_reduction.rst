Integrated Harm Reduction Modeling
==================================

This page details the approach to modeling harm reduction strategies and their impacts on reducing the negative consequences associated with opioid use.

Overview
--------

Integrated harm reduction focuses on strategies that minimize the risks associated with ongoing drug use, while potentially serving as engagement points for treatment. The model evaluates the effects of interventions like naloxone distribution for overdose reversal, syringe services programs (SSPs) for preventing infectious disease, fentanyl test strip availability, and low-barrier healthcare access points.

Key Modeling Components
-----------------------

* **Naloxone Distribution**: Simulating community and first responder naloxone availability and its impact on fatal overdose rates
* **Syringe Services Programs**: Modeling how SSP coverage affects HIV and HCV transmission rates
* **Drug Checking Services**: Representing how fentanyl test strips and other drug checking tools influence use patterns and overdose risk
* **Supervised Consumption Facilities**: Simulating the potential impact of monitored consumption spaces on overdose mortality and treatment engagement
* **Low-Threshold Buprenorphine**: Modeling programs that offer immediate, minimal-requirement access to MOUD

Implementation Parameters
-------------------------

The harm reduction components include parameters for:

* Geographic distribution and accessibility
* Hours of operation and service capacity
* Stigma and utilization barriers
* Integration with other healthcare services
* Legal and policy constraints
* Community acceptance factors

Expected Outcomes
-----------------

The model tracks several outcomes related to harm reduction interventions:

* Fatal and non-fatal overdose rates
* Infectious disease incidence (HIV, HCV)
* Emergency department utilization
* Treatment initiation from harm reduction contacts
* Cost-effectiveness measures
* Public health impact metrics
