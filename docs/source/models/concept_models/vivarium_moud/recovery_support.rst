Recovery Support Modeling
=========================

This page provides detailed information about how the model simulates recovery support services and their impact on long-term recovery outcomes for individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD).

Overview
--------

Recovery support encompasses the range of services that facilitate long-term recovery and wellness beyond acute treatment. The model simulates the effects of increased access to recovery housing, peer recovery support services, employment assistance programs, and other wraparound services aimed at enhancing stabilization.

Key Modeling Components
-----------------------

* **Recovery Housing**: Modeling the impact of stable, substance-free living environments on relapse rates and treatment retention
* **Peer Support Programs**: Simulating how engagement with peer recovery coaches affects long-term abstinence
* **Employment Services**: Representing the effects of vocational training and job placement on social stability and recovery maintenance
* **Care Coordination**: Modeling how case management and service integration influence treatment outcomes
* **Family Support Interventions**: Simulating family therapy and education programs' impact on recovery environment

Implementation Considerations
-----------------------------

The model accounts for variations in:

* Timing of recovery support intervention (during vs. after acute treatment)
* Duration of support services
* Integration with treatment services
* Geographic and demographic accessibility factors
* Funding and reimbursement constraints

Expected Outcomes
-----------------

The recovery support component of the model tracks several key outcomes:

* Sustained abstinence rates at 6, 12, and 24 months
* Employment stability
* Housing security
* Healthcare utilization
* Social functioning measures
* Cost-effectiveness of support services
