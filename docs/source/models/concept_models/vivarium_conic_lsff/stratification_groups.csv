Note: The simulant may not be receiving the full effect of iron fortification even if they are eating iron-fortified food, because 1) Due to childrens' assumed food consumption pattern, the full effect is only seen starting at 2 years of age, and 2) There is a time lag of 6 months to get the full age-dependent effect, even for simulants aged > 2 years"
