Intervention Overview
-----------------------

The hypothetical treatment intervention is triggered by a positive BBBM test, and has the effect of slowing the progression
from pre-clinical to MCI state via the :ref:`BBBM to MCI transition hazard rate i_MCI <2021_cause_alzheimers_presymptomatic_mci_transition_data_table>`. 
In the baseline scenario, i_MCI equals the time-dependent hazard function :math:`h_{MCI}`,
which in the treatment scenario is multiplied by a hazard ratio :math:`R_h` < 1 when a simulant has an active treatment effect in order to slow the progression.
This effect can wane over time (udpated each time step) and when the effect fully expires, :math:`R_h` returns to 1. 

This treatment is hypothetical and we don't have confirmed information about the mechanism.

The diagram above illustrates how a simulant should progress through the various testing and treatment related 
states defined by the client. Each simulant may transition to a new state on each time step. 

Most states have a fixed duration (a multiple of the 
time step length) where simulants will transition after :math:`\text{duration} / \text{time step}` time steps. 
The duration is marked in the state node in brackets eg [6 mo]. As desribed in the :ref:`testing intervention <alzheimers_testing_intervention_bbbm>`, 
some simulants in the `BBBM test eligible` state may transition to tested immediately (low propensity value), some may always self-transition
(ie, never get tested, high propensity value), and some may self-transition for some number of time steps but eventually transition to tested
as a result of the time-specific testing rate increasing.

Some states have zero duration, illustrated with a dashed box (rather than the solid ovals for states with nonzero durations). 
Transitions from a state with zero duration are illustrated with a dashed line. If a simulant transitions to a zero-duration state 
on a time step, they should also immediately continue to the next state during that same time step, as a part of the same transition.

For example, a simulant in `BBBM test eligible` who is tested and moves to `BBBM test received` would then immediately move to one of 
that state's two sinks, and would even move directly to another state during the same transition/ time step on a positive test. 

Below are tables with details on how to model these states and transitions, and necessary data values. 
The value of :math:`i_{MCI}` in the :ref:`cause model <2021_cause_alzheimers_presymptomatic_mci_transition_data_table>` is now updated
to be equal to :math:`h_{adj} = h_{MCI} \cdot R_h`, where :math:`h_{adj}` is the intervention-adjusted hazard rate used for progression to MCI,
:math:`h_{MCI}` is the :ref:`time-dependent hazard function <2021_cause_alzheimers_presymptomatic_mci_transition_data_table>` and :math:`R_h`
is defined below.

    - Lilly: "The percent of patients with a positive BBBM test who initiate treatment will vary by location and over time â€“ but will not vary by age or sex. In the US: 30% of eligible patients initiate (constant 2030-2100); Japan: 80% of eligible patients initiate (constant 2030-2100); all other countries: 40% of eligible patients initiate in 2030, increasing linearly to 70% by 2035, remaining constant at 70% until 2100.""

    - Zero duration. Random draw
  * - Full treatment effect LONG
    - Treatment takes effect exactly 6 months after recieving a positive BBBM test (if :math:`\text{prop}_I < I`)
    - On transition to this state, :math:`R_h = R_d`. Set :math:`h_{adj} = R_h \cdot h_{MCI}`, slowing progression to MCI.
      Transition from this state after the fixed duration.
  * - Full treatment effect SHORT
    -
    - Same effect size as in `Full treatment effect LONG` but with a shorter fixed duration
  * - Waning treatment effect LONG
    -
    - On every time step where the simulant started the time step in this state (ie, don't do it on the initial transition),
      increase :math:`R_h` by :math:`\frac{(1 - R_d)}{s}`, where :math:`s` is the number of time steps in this state's duration.
      This will decrease the effect size linearly until reaching :math:`R_h = 1` on transition to the `No treatment effect` state.
      Set :math:`h_{adj} = R_h \cdot h_{MCI}`.
      Transition from this state after the fixed duration.
  * - Waning treatment effect SHORT
    -
    - Same effect size as in `Waning treatment effect LONG` but with a shorter fixed duration
  * - No treatment effect
    - 
    - :math:`R_h` should equal 1 on the first time step the simulant spends in this state.
      So :math:`h_{adj} = h_{MCI}`

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since :math:`I` is 0 until 2030, on simulation initialization no simulants have received treatment.

.. _alzheimers_intervention_treatment_assumptions:

Assumptions and Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Those who do not initiate treatment following their first positive BBBM test result, or those who discontinue, 
  will never take the intervention, so propensity can be assigned for simulant lifetime
- Treatment occurs instantaneously (ie, the duration of the treatment period is zero), following a six-month waiting period from time of BBBM test. 
  So, treatment takes effect exactly six months after BBBM testing. 
  This interprets the following two Lilly specifications: "The treatment takes immediate full effect in the first 6-month time step" and 
  "There is an average of 6 months between a positive BBBM test result and initiating treatment". We simplify 
  average of 6 months to fixed 6 month duration for all simulants. 
  Discontinuation occurs during this instantaneous treatment period.
