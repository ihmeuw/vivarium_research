  This page underwent a revision in December of 2022 to reflect an a desired modeling strategy update of the :ref:`phase II acute malnutrition simulation <2020_concept_model_vivarium_ciff_sam>` in response to updated effect size data and feedback obtained from collaborators. `The pull request associated with these updates can be found here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research/pull/1097>`_. A summary of the associated changes to the modeling strategy includes:

  - Data changes to effect of SQ-LNS on moderate and severe stunting
  - Change to how stunting effects are applied (increases in stunting TMREL category rather than mild stunting category)
  - SQ-LNS effects on stunting will persist until 5 years of age instead of ceasing at 2 years of age
  - SQ-LNS impacts on each wasting transition rate (including remission rates) rather than only the transition rate between mild and moderate wasting

  - Change in age thresholds for different SQLNS/wasting effect sizes.

Ideally, infants are breastfed for two years or longer, with complementary food introduced at six months of age. Diets of infants and young children aged six to 23 months need to include a variety of nutrient-dense foods, preferably from local sources, to ensure their nutrient needs are met. However, children's diets are likely to be deficient in macronutrients and micronutrients, specifically essential fatty acids, when nutrient-rich diets are not available to them in resource-poor settings. Various interventions are recommended, or have been used, to improve child malnutrition. This document focuses on small quantity lipid based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) as an intervention to improve malnutrition, particularly child wasting and stunting. Particularly, it draws on the 2019 Cochrane Review by Das et. al. [DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019]_

Intervention Overview
-----------------------

:underline:`Lipid-based nutrient supplements`

Supplementary feeding is a strategy that includes provision of extra food to children beyond the normal ration of their home diets
and is aimed at improving the nutritional status or preventing the nutritional deterioration of the target population. One of the nutritional
interventions advocated to address malnutrition among children is **lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS)**. LNS are a family of
products designed to deliver nutrients to vulnerable people. They are considered 'lipid-based' because most of the energy provided
by these products is from lipids (fats). All LNS provide a range of vitamins and minerals, but unlike most other micronutrient supplements,
LNS also provide *energy, protein and essential fatty acids*. LNS recipes can include a variety of ingredients, but typically have included vegetable fat, peanut or groundnut paste, milk powder and sugar. Based on the energy content, LNS can be small quantity (SQ LNS) providing ˜ 110 to 120 kcal/day (20 g dose), medium quantity (MQ LNS) providing ˜ 250 to 500 kcal/day (45 g to 90 g dose) or large-quantity (LQ LNS) providing
more than 280 kcal/day (> 90 g dose). Notably, MQ-LNS and LQ-LNS can be used in :ref:`management of acute malnutrition interventions <intervention_wasting_treatment>`. Additionally, :ref:`antenatal supplementation with balanced energy protein (BEP) <maternal_supplementation_intervention>` utilitizes LNS products. LNS are nutrient dense, require no cooking before use, and can be stored for months even in warm conditions.
[DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019]_

:underline:`Alternative recipes and formulations, other than LNS`

Alternative recipes and formulations, other than LNS, are currently being explored using cereals mixed with other ingredients, including
whey, soy protein isolate, dried skimmed milk, and sesame, cashew and chickpea paste, among others. These are
fortified with vitamins and minerals and are commonly called **fortified blended foods (FBF)**. An example of a commonly used FBF
is **corn soy blend plus (CSB ++)**, which is a cooked blend of milled, heat-treated corn and soybeans that is fortified with a vitamin and
mineral premix. **Multiple micronutrient powders (MNP)** are also an alternative way of providing micronutrients. These are single-dose
packets of vitamins and minerals in powder form that can be sprinkled onto any ready to eat semi-solid food consumed at home,
school or any other point of use. [DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019]_

:underline:`Description of intervention`

The intervention is the supplementation of children from aged **6 months to 23 months** with **LNS + complementary feeding** (intervention) compared with no intervention (control). The setting of the intervention is the community.

:underline:`Summary of existing intervention literature`

There have been several recent meta-analyses on the effects of SQ-LNS, outlined below:

- A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019]_. Please see this memo for a summary of the studies and the effect sizes :download:`SQ-LNS interventions memo<sqlns_memo_das2019.docx>`

- A meta-analysis of RCTs on all-cause mortality [Stewart-et-al-2020]_

  - All-cause mortality was significantly lower in the SQ-LNS arm than the non-SQ-LNS arm (RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.89; 13 trials)

- A series of individual participant data meta-analyses (with analysis of effect modification), as summarized by [Dewey-et-al-2021a]_. These papers included eligible studies from the review published by [DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019]_ as well as additional data published following the publication of the cochrane review. Minimum supplementation duration for inclusion was three months between the ages of six and 24 months of age. Most studies began supplementation at six months of age with intended supplementation duration of 6-18 months. The series included individual analyses on the following outcomes:

  - Growth outcomes: [Dewey-et-al-2021b]_

    - Stunting prevalence ratio: 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.91)

    - Wasting prevalence ratio: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.93) and acute malnutrition prevalence ratio: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.93)

      - Effect modified by sex

  - Severe growth outcomes: [Dewey-et-al-2022]_

    - Severe stunting prevalence ratio: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.90)

    - Severe wasting prevalence ration: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.86)

    - Concurrent severe stunting and severe wasting prevalence ratio: 0.47 (0.30, 0.73)

    - Effects modified by level of wasting and stunting burden

  - Anemia and micronutrient status: [Wessells-et-al-2021]_

    - Significantly decreased anemia and vitamin A deficiency

    - No effect on plasma zinc or retinol

  - Developmental outcomes: [Prado-et-al-2021]_

    - Increased mean language, social-emotional, and motor scores.

    - Increased prevalence of walking without support at 12 months

Note, we have received data directly from the [Dewey-et-al-2021b]_ authors on the 4-category severity-specific prevalence ratios of SQ-LNS wasting and stunting. This data can be found at :code:`J:\Project\simulation_science\ciff_malnutrition\Data\sqlns_effects\ipd_list request_20220727.xlsx` and will be what we use to inform our analysis.

Utilization algorithms
++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will consider two concepts of SQ-LNS services, including coverage and utilization:

**1. Coverage:** *access* to the intervention (such as living in an area where SQ-LNS products are available and in use). This will be determined by coverage scale-up algorithms in the concept model document.

Possible coverage values include:

- **Uncovered:** Not supplemented by SQ-LNS currently or in the past. Simulants aged 6 months to 5 years are eligible for this category.
- **Covered:** Actively receiving SQ-LNS supplementation. Simulants aged 6 months to 18 months are eligible for this category. Simulants in this category are subject to the SQ-LNS effects on wasting and stunting.
- **Received:** No longer actively receiving SQ-LNS supplementation, but did receive SQ-LNS supplementation before the age of 18 months. Simulants aged 18 months to 5 years are eligible for this category. Simulants in this category are subject to the SQ-LNS effects on stunting, but not wasting.

**2. Utilization:** *use* of the intervention (actually taking the supplements and receiving the effects). This will be determined by the utilization algorithms below.

There are various SQ-LNS utilization algorithms that may be desired under differing scenarios. They include:

- **Universal coverage:** All covered simulants receive effects starting at six months of age.
- **Targeted to AM treatment:** Covered simulants who transition from MAM or SAM to mild wasting will receive intervention effects starting at that timestep.
- **Targeted to mild wasting:** Covered simulants who are initialized into or transition into the mild wasting state will receive intervention effects starting at that timestep.

SQ-LNS effects on wasting will persist until 18 months of age and effects on stunting will persist until five years of age.

Targeted SQ-LNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The team has decided to run the model for each subnational location with 
SQ-LNS "on" and "off" and test different targeting plans for SQ-LNS in a separate 
notebook. The goal of this approach is to allow for more extensive testing of 
different possible targeting approaches and the option to run a regression and 
create a more complex metric. 

To achieve this, we will create an emulator to combine results from individual 
subnationals where SQ-LNS is on and off to create a national result for targeting 
a given list of regions. The metrics used for generating targeting lists are 
undecided currently, but we expect to use child growth failure metrics and 
child mortality as starting examples. One of the metrics we plan to test is 
outlined in more detail below. 

This section will continue to be updated as we design the emulator and create 
other targeting approaches. 

The WHO has issued guidelines on the use and targeting of SQ-LNS, 
which are available here: `WHO guidelines <https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/7352/section/133966>`_. 
These guidelines state that "in areas of or during periods of 
high food insecurity" providing SQ-LNS or similar food supplementation 
might be appropriate. They state that targeting to a geographic region 
or to specific children or households might be appropriate. Additionally 
they recommend using the food security metric to determine targeting.

However, these guidelines are quite vague. This 
is a relatively new intervention and so the best metric for targeting 
is still being debated. Simulation is especially well suited for these 
types of questions, and so we will try several different SQ-LNS targeting 
criteria.

For all criteria, a csv file with the subnational locations and whether or 
not they are included in targeting will be provided.

    - See note below

.. note::

  The WHO guidelines included above state that targeting should be based off of food security, more specifically it should be targeted to those who are severely food insecure. Based on `FAOSTAT data <https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS>`_, this would be when approximately 20% of the population is targeted as severaly food insecure. We are using underweight as a proxy for severe food insecurity as it is already in our model, and it is a better representation of concurrent stunting and wasting - which is more dangerous that stunting or wasting alone.

  Additionally, Indi Trehan recommended using underweight as a metric. Weight is more commonly tracked in practice than height, making this data more available than stunting or wasting.

  A preliminary version of `targeting based on underweight was created in this notebook <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nutrition_optimization/blob/386cf36f7dcd6073077dd8f663b17d0b740ef60f/data_prep/sqlns_subnational/Underweight-based%20targeting%20threshold%20exploration.ipynb>`_. However, we are waiting for confirmation from Rahul before continuing with this approach. This `food insecurity target list <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nutrition_optimization/blob/386cf36f7dcd6073077dd8f663b17d0b740ef60f/data_prep/sqlns_subnational/food_insecurity_target_list.csv>`_ can be used as a placeholder for testing the model to run targeted SQ-LNS. 


Affected Outcomes
+++++++++++++++++

Effect Modification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The effect size of SQ-LNS has been shown to change based on stunting or wasting prevalence 
in a location [Dewey-et-al-2022]_. Therefore, we are including a sensitivity analysis where 
there are two SQ-LNS effect sizes - based on if the subnational location surpasses a wasting 
prevalence threshold of 10%. This is separate from targeting.

Wasting prevalence was selected over stunting because the other interventions in our model 
focus on wasting treatment (SAM and MAM treatment), and therefore the prevention vs treatment 
framework is most relevant and interesting in high wasting burden locations. At current, we are 
waiting for input from Indi Trehan on guidance for whether wasting or stunting is a more 
appropriate effect modifier to use.

The effect modified impact on stunting and wasting were calulated in the same way as the standard 
impacts. We first identified the subnational locations that would receive the higher and lower 
effect sizes using this `SQLNS effect modification testing notebook <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nutrition_optimization/blob/5bd6e8845ea852129e1a977b47472c5da62a2400/data_prep/sqlns_subnational/sqlns_effect_modification_prep.ipynb>`_, and then used the same process as before
to generate the wasting transition impacts.

We again received data inputs from the team at UC Davis showing the prevalence ratio for each 
category separated by high and low burden locations. This data is stored at :code:`J:\Project\simulation_science\ciff_malnutrition\Data\sqlns_effects\ipd_list request_20240620.xlsx`. 
The trials included in this meta-analysis were identical to those included in the prior meta-analysis. 
The new data here was the prevalence ratios separated by high and low burden regions. 

In generating the wasting transition data from the prevalence ratios, we encountered a few limitations: 

- The upper bound of the prevalence ratio for low burden regions was greater than 1. This would imply that SQ-LNS has a negative impact. For our model, we set the upper limit to be exactly 1, indicating no impact. This is implemented in cell [2] of the effect generation notebook, in the line `validation_targets_ucl_low_burden = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.01]`.
- For the lower bounds, sometimes the limits were lower than could be acheived in our nanosim. In these cases, we do not hit the prevalence ratio at 10 months. We reach the prevalence ratio later, or in some cases approach it without fully acheiving it. We believe this is a reasonable limitation.


Wasting
~~~~~~~

.. note::

  These values changed in both the 8/22, 12/22, and 9/23 updates

Since the effect of SQ-LNS on child wasting was measured in prevalence ratios, it is not known whether SQ-LNS reduces wasting prevalence through a reduction of wasting incidence or duration. Therefore, we will run a sensitivity analysis in which SQ-LNS affects wasting incidence rates and another in which SQ-LNS affects wasting recovery rates. There is some evidence from [Huybregts-et-al-2019-sqlns]_ that SQ-LNS affects the incidence of acute malnutrition and some evidence that it may affect time to recovery, although it appears that the pathway through incidence is the primary route by which SQ-LNS impacts wasting prevalence from this limited evidence. 

Additionally, due to the multi-compartment transition model of child wasting used in our simulation, we cannot apply the observed prevalence ratios directly to wasting transition rates to replicate the intended prevalence ratios. Rather, we solved for specific transition rate ratios (separately for incidence and recovery rates) that resulted in the intended prevalence ratios of SQ-LNS. Due to the finding by [Huybregts-et-al-2019-sqlns]_ that "the difference between study arms in the probability of developing the first AM episode mainly occurred during the first 4 months of follow-up and then remained constant" (p. 19), we decided to implement age-specific effects such that for those who begin SQ-LNS supplementation at six months of age, the prevalence ratios from the meta-analysis are achieved at 12 months of age and maintained through 23 months of age. Notably, these values were calibrated to the child population in Ethiopia and the calibration may not hold for all other populations and should be tested before applying to different locations. 

Notebooks that generated these values can be found here:

- `"Wasting paper" implementation (12/22 update) <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_wasting/blob/main/misc_investigations/Prevalence%20ratio%20nano%20sim%2C%20age-specific.ipynb>`_.

- `Nutrition optimization implementation (9/23 update that uses wasting transition rates from Wave I of the nutrition optimization model) <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nutrition_optimization/blob/data_prep/data_prep/sqlns/Prevalence%20ratio%20nano%20sim%2C%20age-specific.ipynb>`_. Note that only incidence effects have been calculated for this project, as they are thought to be the primary route through which SQ-LNS affects child wasting, although we may revisit this assumption after more investigation into individual SQ-LNS trials that may provide guidance.

- `Subnational optimization by location (5/29 update to have location specific values) <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nutrition_optimization/blob/386cf36f7dcd6073077dd8f663b17d0b740ef60f/data_prep/sqlns/sqlns_effect_size_generation_subnational.ipynb>`_. No changes in approach, this was an adjustment to run for many locations successfully only.

- `Subnational optimization with effect modification <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nutrition_optimization/blob/8718562f3419a10c03106ef7d45b28c7a9a65833/data_prep/sqlns/sqlns_effect_size_generation_subnational.ipynb>`_. This includes the new effect modification for all locations. The `data used in the model <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nutrition_optimization/blob/8718562f3419a10c03106ef7d45b28c7a9a65833/data_prep/sqlns/modified_and_standard_subnational_sqlns_effects_v1.csv>`_. 

Wasting transition rates affected by SQ-LNS are documented on the :ref:`dynamic wasting transition model document <2021_risk_exposure_wasting_state_exposure>`. The intervention effect should apply immediately upon coverage of the intervention and should be applied *multiplicatively* to the affected measure. 

The SQ-LNS effects on wasting transition rates should apply to simulants covered by SQ-LNS from the start of coverage (at six months of age) until they are 18 months of age, at which point SQ-LNS should no longer affect their transition rates. In other words, the :code:`covered` SQ-LNS coverage state affects wasting transitions rates, but the :code:`received` and :code:`uncovered` states do not.

.. note::

  Lognormal distributions of uncertainty should be used for all effect sizes in the table below and the uncertainty intervals. We have confirmed that the lognormal distribution reasonably replicates the uncertainty intervals for these effects in this `SQLNS dsitribution check notebook <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nutrition_optimization/blob/data_prep/data_prep/SQLNS_distribution_check.ipynb>`_.

  The same percentile should be sampled from within each uncertainty interval for ALL of the effect samples (across age groups and measures) for each draw of the simulation.

.. note::
  
  We reviewed the individual studies included in [Dewey-et-al-2021b]_ to check if any evaluated the effects of SQ-LNS on wasting incidence rather than prevalence ([Dewey-et-al-2021b]_ focused on prevalence). Few RCTs reported on incidence, but those that did had similar findings as our back-calculated incidence values (e.g., [Huybregts-et-al-2019-sqlns]_).

  [Becquey-et-al-2019]_ reported lower or null incidence rate effects than we use in our model, but they also found low or null effects of SQLNS on prevalence and recovery as well, so we believe their results to not be representative based on what we know about overall SQLNS effects from [Dewey-et-al-2021b]_.

  None of the RCTs included in [Dewey-et-al-2021b]_ reported on recovery rates. However, [Huybregts-et-al-2019-sqlns]_ found no significant difference in the
  length of treatment between the group that received SQ-LNS and those that didn't. This confirms our assumption that SQ-LNS works via reducing incidence rather than speeding up recovery.

Stunting
~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 

  These values changed in the December, but not August, 2022 update

**We will apply the SQ-LNS prevalence ratios on the** :ref:`stunting risk exposure distribution <2020_risk_exposure_child_stunting>` **among simulants covered by SQ-LNS from the start of supplementation (six months of age) until they turn five years of age.** In other words, both the :code:`covered` and :code:`received` SQ-LNS coverage states affect stunting, but the :code:`uncovered` state does not. The application of the SQ-LNS effect on stunting through five years of age (beyond the duration of supplementation) was advised by collaborators, with the rationale that height gains achieved during SQ-LNS supplementation will persist throughout life (unlike wasting-associated weight gains). 

Additionally, as suggested by the observed prevalence ratios from the meta-analysis, we will assume that SQ-LNS results in decreases to the prevalence of moderate and severe stunting, no change to the prevalence of mild stunting, and increases to the stunting TMREL category that are equal to the sum of the decreases in prevalence of moderate and severe stunting. The figure below demonstrates how to apply the effects summarized in the table to the stunting risk exposure distribution of simulants affected by SQ-LNS.

Not currently modeled as part of the :ref:`wasting simulation <2020_concept_model_vivarium_ciff_sam>` given that only YLDs will be affected.

Vitamin A Deficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not currently modeled as part of the :ref:`wasting simulation <2020_concept_model_vivarium_ciff_sam>` as this is not a primary outcome of interest and any downstream effects on mortality will be included in the `Mortality`_ outcome above.

Cost Model
+++++++++++

Assumptions and Limitations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- We assume a constant effect of SQ-LNS wasting transition rates. This means that wasting prevalence ratios will equal 1 at the start of supplementation and progress towards the measured prevalence ratios until they reach a level of stability at some later point. We make this assumption in the absence of measured prevalence ratios as mutliple follow-up points.

- We assume that these effect generalize from the populations included in the meta-analysis of SQ-LNS trials to our simulated populations.

Validation and Verification Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- verification: coverage of SQ-LNS as a function of time and eligible populations in baseline and intervention scenario
- verification: prevalence of stunting in supplemented vs non-supplemented group
- verification: wasting transition rates in supplemented vs non-supplemented group
- validation: check that the wasting prevalence ratios replicate the desired values
