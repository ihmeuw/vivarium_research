Overview
++++++++

The goal of this population model is to model only simulants with
Alzheimer's disease (and other dementias), in order to reduce the
necessary population size for the :ref:`CSU Alzheiemer's simulation
<2025_concept_model_vivarium_alzheimers>`. The model document is split
into two parts: 1) Initializing the population, and 2) adding new
simulants during the simulated timeframe.
