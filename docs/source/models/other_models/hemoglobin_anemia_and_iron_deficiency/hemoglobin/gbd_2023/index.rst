GBD 2023 Hemoglobin Model
=====================================

There were significant changes to the GBD modeling strategy for iron deficiency/hemoglobin as a risk factor between the GBD 2021 and GBD 2023 rounds. Notably, a final decision has not yet been made (as of March 2025) as to whether the strategy used in prior GBD rounds (iron deficiency risk factor, consistent with the :ref:`2019/2021 implementation <2019_hemoglobin_model>`) or the new strategy (hemoglobin risk factor) will be included for publication in GBD 2023.

However, GBD teams have completed risk exposure and risk effect estimation (for a subset of affected outcomes) for an updated hemoglobin risk factor as of March 2025. See the :ref:`hemoglobin risk exposure <2023_hemoglobin_exposure>` and :ref:`hemoglobin risk effects <2023_hemoglobin_effects>` risk factor pages for details.
