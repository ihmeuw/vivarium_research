The Vivarium Modeling Workflow
==============================

The Simulation Science team is actively working on building out and improving a
model development workflow to guide the interactions between researchers and
software engineers.
Additional model development process is migrating here from the
Hub. Until then, you can still find the process documentation there!

- `The Model Development Process on the Hub <https://hub.ihme.washington.edu/display/COS/Model+Development>`_

This documentation is generated collaboratively during weekly
:ref:`documentation sessions <process_documentation>`.
