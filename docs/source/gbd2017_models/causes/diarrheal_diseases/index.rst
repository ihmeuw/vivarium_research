Diarrheal Diseases

Disease Description
-------------------

We follow GBD 2017 and "defined diarrhoeal disease episodes as three or more 
loose stools in a 24-hour period." (p. 88 of 
[GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1]_).

Diarrhea has various etiologies, with infectious diarrhea accounting for the 
vast majority of global diarrheal disease burden. The top pathogens responsible 
for diarrhea include norovirus, rotavirus, E. Coli, Camplyobacter, and 
Salmonella. Bacterial infections, and specifically species of Shigella, 
account for the majority of bloody diarrhea.

Infection most commonly occurs via feces-contamined water, and can also spread 
via contamined food and person-to-person contact. ([WHO]_)

The global prevalence of diarrhea thus varies considerably accoring to resource 
access. In particular, resource-limited countries have a "baseline frequency... 
superimposed with epidemic cases of diarrhea" ([UpToDate_1]_). The top risk 
factors for diarrheal diseases thus include crowding (such as living in refugee 
camps) and poor sanitation, in addition to immune system-compromising conditions, 
such as living with HIV.

The most significant outcomes of a nonfatal diarrhea episode are dehydration and 
the loss of nutrition. In particular, in low-income countries, the high 
prevalence of diarrhea is a major cause of child malnutrition ([WHO]_), which 
in turn makes such children more susceptible to future diarrheal episodes and 
other negative sequelae.

The WHO-recommended measures for diarrhea prevention include:
	- Access to safe drinking water;
	- Use of improved sanitation;
	- Hand washing with soap;
	- Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life;
	- Good personal and food hygiene;
	- Health education about how infections spread; and
	- Rotavirus vaccination.

Noninfectious diarrhea etiologies are far less common, but are more likely among 
chronic cases of diarrhea. Causes of noninfectious diarrhea include ischemic 
colitis, inflammatory bowl disease, among others ([UpToDate_2]_).

Modeling Diarrheal Diseases in GBD 2017
---------------------------------------

The GBD diarrheal diseases model follows a standard GBD framework, including a 
cause of death (CoD) model and a nonfatal model.

The CoD model estimates the cause-specific mortality rate (CSMR) within the
total population, and a cause fraction. These estimates are based on vital
registration and verabal autopsy data.

The nonfatal model is run in DisMod. The primary inputs are prevalence epi data,
for which self-reported prevalence is the reference definition, and the CSMR
estimates from CodCorrect. Separately, the ratio of mild/moderate/severe
diarrhea is estimated, based on data from a systematic review. These severity
ratio estimates do not vary by age/sex/location/year, and are applied to the
prevalence and incidence estimates produced by DisMod to produce the three
sequela of diarrheal diseases: mild diarrheal diseases, moderate diarrheal
diseases, and severe diarrheal diseases. In our model, every individual will
have the average severity for their age/sex/location/year. 

The GBD 2017 adjusted for seasonal variation in diarrheal disease, but we have
not attempted to include this variation in Vivarium yet. (p. 89)

There is substantial additional effort in GBD to divide diarrhea burden into the
aetiologies of diarrhea, but we have not included aetiologies in this simple
model.
