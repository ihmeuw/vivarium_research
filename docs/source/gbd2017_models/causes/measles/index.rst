Disease Description
-------------------

Measles_ is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by the measles virus
(*Measles morbillivirus*). Symptoms usually develop 10-12 days after exposure to
the virus, and last 7-10 days. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose,
conjunctivitis, characteristic white spots inside the cheek (called Koplik's
spots), and a red, flat, blotchy skin rash that develops on average 14 days
after exposure to the virus (range, 7-21 days) and lasts 5-6 days. Recovery from
measles confers lifelong immunity. [WHO-Measles]_, [CDC-Measles]_, [Wikipedia-Measles]_,
[GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1-Measles]_

Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the
disease. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis, severe
diarrhea, ear infections, and pneumonia. Serious complications are more common
in children under the age of 5 or adults over the age of 30, especially those
with vitamin A deficiency or those whose immune systems have been weakened by
HIV/AIDS or other diseases [WHO-Measles]_.

Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, or direct
contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. The virus remains active and
contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours. It can be
transmitted by an infected person from 4 days prior to the onset of the rash to
4 days after the rash erupts [WHO-Measles]_, [CDC-Measles]_, [Wikipedia-Measles]_.

Before the introduction of a measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination,
major epidemics occurred approximately every 2–3 years, and measles caused an
estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. Despite the availability of a vaccine,
approximately 110,000 people died from measles in 2017, mostly children under
the age of 5 years. However, due to accelerated immunization activities, global
measles deaths have decreased 80% during the period 2000–2017, from an estimated
545,000 to  110,000, and measles vaccination prevented an estimated  21.1
million deaths during 2000–2017 [WHO-Measles]_.

The `ICD 10`_ codes for measles are B05-B05.9, Z24.4, and ICD 9 codes are
055-055.9, 484.0, V04.2, V73.2 [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1-Measles]_.

   Also perhaps note this recent New York Times article (Oct 31, 2019):

     `Measles Makes Your Immune System’s Memory Forget Defenses Against Other Illnesses <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/health/measles-vaccine-immune-system.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage>`_:
     New research shows the virus can have devastating effects on the immune system that persist much longer than the illness itself.


Modeling Measles in GBD 2017
----------------------------

.. todo::

   Add relevant detail about measles modeling process from
   [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1-Measles]_ and from the `CoD Capstone
   <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32203-7>`_ Appendix. Note that each
   country's vaccine coverage went into the estimation of measles incidence
   rates, which are then multiplied by an average disease duration of 10 days to
   compute prevalence.

   Describe enough of the data sources and modeling process to verify that even
   though  measles can lead to diarrhea or other causes that we include in our
   Vivarium models, we won't be double counting mortality and morbidity from
   these causes. For example, a death caused by diarrheal dehydration due to
   measles should be counted in the GBD as a death due to measles, not as a
   death due to diarrheal diseases.

   The relationship with vitamin A deficiency may also be important for our
   models.

   Make sure to check on measles sequelae as well. Our models so far have not paid much attention to the nonfatal side, but it looks like some of the complications can persist well after someone recovers from measles, so maybe that's important to think about.

Model Assumptions and Limitations
---------------------------------

This model is designed to be used for estimating DALYs due to measles that are
averted from a country-level intervention (e.g. food fortification or
supplementation given to a percentage of the population) that can reduce measles
incidence as a downstream effect.

In particular, there are various uses for which this model is **not** suitable.
For example:

1. The simple measles model described here does not explicitly incorporate
vaccine coverage or efficacy, hence cannot be used to model the impact of a
vaccination campaign.

2. This model uses country-level data, and cannot be used to model local measles
outbreaks due to lack of vaccination in small communities.

Some of the **assumptions** made in this model are:

1. There is no data available for population in recovered state in GBD. 
So, we considered all the population who do not have measles as susceptible  This includes both susceptible and recovered population.
To compensate this, the incidence rate among susceptible and recovered population is used for transition.

2. There is no data avaialable for remission rate in GBD. So a constant remission rate is 
calculated from average case duration assumption of 10 days [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1-Measles]_.

   Describe more limitations and assumptions of the model as appropriate. For example,
   
   * There are 2 ways people can be in the "recovered" state - either they get measles and then recover, or 
     they get vaccinated and move directly into the "recovered" state without ever having the disease. 
     We should look into measles vaccination rates in the countries we're interested in (Nigeria, India, Ethiopia) 
     and compare this to the number of people who actually get measles. If the number of vaccinated people is much
     higher than the number who get the disease, then our assumption will have a smaller effect, because the few 
     people who enter the recovered state in our model will be be a small proportion of the total number of people
     in the recovered state, and the GBD incidence rate is already accounting for people who are "recovered" by vaccination.   
   * We should also look at the case fatality rate / excess mortality rate for measles, as this will also have an 
     impact on the effect of this assumption, as well as on our assumption of a constant remission rate.   
   * There are ways we could try to estimate the people who are in the recovered state, but it is probably not 
     worth the effort and added complexity for this model, particularly because we are not explicitly modeling vaccinations.   
   * For our assumption of a constant remission rate (below), we should think about what the actual hazard function for 
     remission should look like (we should be able to get some idea about this from the disease description), and 
     estimate how replacing it with a constant rate will affect our results.
   * Also include about GBD's assumption of 50% of measles cases as moderate and other 50% as severe.

     - Clearly room for improvement. There is no data available for the number of recovered people in GBD. 
       So we included recovered among susceptible during initialization and calculating incident rate.
       This is done to simplify the model as the focus is on LSFF but not on measles.
