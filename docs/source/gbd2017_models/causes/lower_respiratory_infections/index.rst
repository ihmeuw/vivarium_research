Lower Respiratory Infections
============================

Disease Description
-------------------

Lower respiratory infections (*LRI*), principally clinician-diagnosed pneumonia
and bronchiolitis, is a major global killer of both children and adults. Symptoms
include shortness of breath, weakness, fever, coughing and fatigue. It is important to check for a fever. Symptoms can last about 7 days and the infection is contagious
to others shortly before and while experiencing symptoms. It is mainly
caused by four pathogens - Streptococcus pneumoniae (*pneumococcal
pneumonia*), Haemophilus influenzae type B (*Hib*), influenza, and respiratory
syncytial virus (*RCV*). Those pathogens may co-infect.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is the largest cause of LRI
mortality. [Wikipedia-LRI]_, [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1-lri]_

The lower respiratory tract or lower airway is derived from the developing foregut
and consists of the trachea, bronchi (primary, secondary and tertiary),
bronchioles (including terminal and respiratory), and lungs (including alveoli).
It also sometimes includes the larynx. [Wikipedia-LRI]_

Transmission of LRI may occur via several pathways, including direct physical contact,
fomites, direct droplet spread, and suspended small particles. Intermingling of
large numbers of people can facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens. [CDC-LRI]_

In GBD 2016, malnutrition was identified as a leading risk factor for lower respiratory infection
mortality among children younger than 5 years and, together with air pollution (both household and ambient)
and increased antibiotic use, was identified as a focus for targeted intervention measures. [Lancet]_

Modeling LRI in GBD 2017
------------------------
The GBD 2017 defined the time to recovery for LRI as an average of 10 days (*5-15 days*),
which corresponds with a remission 36.5.

GBS stands for Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Model Assumptions and Limitations
---------------------------------
This model is designed to be used for estimating DALYs due to LRI that are averted from a
country-level intervention(e.g. food fortification or supplementation given to a percentage of the population)
that can reduce LRI incidence as a downstream effect.

There is substantial additional effort in GBD to divide LRI
burden into the aetiologies of LRI, but we do not include
aetiologies in this simple model.

There are three sequelae associated with LRI. We are not tracking the long-term
effects of Guillain-Barré syndrome (which can include paralysis, for example). However, since the prevalence of GBS is so low,
there would probably not be much benefit in attempting to capture its long-term YLDs in addition to its short term YLDs.

.. note::

	Birth prevalence of LRI was allowed in the DISMOD modeling process for LRI. However, it was not reported as a final result in GBD 2017. LRI birth prevalence must therefore be retreieved using get_model_results('epi', 1258, age_group_id=164, measure_id=5, gbd_round_id=5, year_id=2017) or get_draws('modelable_entity_id', 1258, source='epi', age_group_id=164, measure_id=5, gbd_round_id=5, year_id=2017).

Validation Criteria
-------------------

Baseline vivarium model results should compare to GBD artifact data with respect to age-, sex-, location-, and year-specific LRI:

- Birth prevalence
- Prevalence
- Incidence rate
- Remission rate
- Cause-specifc mortality rate
- Excess mortality rate
- YLDs due to LRI
- YLLs due to LRI

.. note::

	The prior bound for the LRI remission rate is 7.3 days, which is longer than the duration of the early neonatal age group (6 days), so theoretically there should be few or no remitted cases of LRI in the early neonatal age group. However, LRI birth prevalence is expected to be greater than LRI prevalence in the early neonatal age group due to LRI's excess mortality rate.
