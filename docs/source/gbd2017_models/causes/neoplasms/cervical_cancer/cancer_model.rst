Disease Overview
++++++++++++++++

Cervical cancer is a female-specific cancer. It is prevalent globally, ranked 
as the fourth-most common cancer in women. In 2018, about 106,430 new cervical 
cancer cases are diagnosed in China and about 47,739 cervical cancer deaths occur 
annually in China. For women at 50-54 years of age, the incidence of cervical 
cancer reaches its maximum value, 30 cases per 100,000 person-years. The deaths 
due to cervical cancer increase over age, and have the highest value 29 per 
100,000 person-years in elder people who aged above 75 years.

GBD 2017 Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The cervical cancer model includes both benign and invasive state. Benign 
cervival cancer is modelled together with uterine cancer, namely `benign and in 
situ cervical and uterine neoplasms`. GBD directly processed the combined 
clinical informatics data in DisMod so they donâ€™t have a way to split it in 
cause level. However, it seems doable if the clinical informatics team could 
remap this cause to benign cervical and uterine separately in next round.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Things to consider: 

1. Within GBD 2017 data, there is no remission rate for invasive cervical cancer.
2. After diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer if a patient survives more than 
   10 years, they are considered cured for calculating disability. Additionally, per GBD 2017, the patients also do not have excess mortality rate after 10 years. In vivarium simulation model, we will remit them back to a recovered state.
3. Keep simulants in benign cervical cancer state and don't go into remission 
   after successful treatment unless literature tells us otherwise.
4. Most of the benign cervical cancer cases are resutling from a disease state 
   called `hrHPV-infected`, where only high risk subtypes 16 and 18 of HPV 
   infection are considered in our model. Though we do include the transition 
   from susceptible state to benign cervical cancer state without high-risk HPV infection.

Compartmental Diagram
+++++++++++++++++++++

  .. image:: cervical_cancer_cause_model_diagram.svg

.. note::

   Regression of BCC will not be included in our Vivarium cause model, this is 
   because we have little evidence to tell how it varies by age and subtypes of 
   HPV infection. This measure may confound our assumption on duration of BCC. 
   For simulants have BCC caused by high-risk HPV infection (subtypes 16 and 18),
   it brings more complexity to allow for two transition pathways: 1) regress 
   from `BCC_C_hrHPV to hrHPV-infected`; 2) regress from `BCC_C_hrHPV to 
   Susceptible`. Notably, the detection of BCC cases would change if we add 
   it back for future model improvement.

  Describe dismod approach to estimate consistent rates for:
   - prevalence, incidence, and remission of high risk HPV infection.
   - prevalence, incidence, and regression of benign cervical cancer

Prevalence ratio calculation:

1. MarketScan research databases capture person-specific clinical utilization, expenditures, and enrollment across inpatient, outpatient, prescription drug and carve-out services. 
   Currently GBD estimates bundle benign and in situ cervical and uterine neoplasms. Thus, we use external marketScan data source to calculate ratio of benign to malignant cervical cancer. 
2. Outpatient year 2016 and 2017 data were pulled with following ICD 10 codes: C53 Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri, C53.0 Malignant neoplasm of endocervix, C53.1 Malignant neoplasm 
   of exocervix, C53.8 Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of cervix uteri, C53.9 Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri, D06  (CIN3) Carcinoma in situ of cervix uteri, D06.0 Carcinoma in situ of 
   endocervix, D06.1 Carcinoma in situ of exocervix, D06.7 Carcinoma in situ of other parts of cervix, D06.9 Carcinoma in situ of cervix, N87.1 (CIN2) Moderate cervical dysplasia, Z12.4 
   Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of cervix. 
3. Non-medicare (age 0-65) & medicare (subset age 65+ only) were merged together to include all ages and limited to screened female patients only. After concatenating 2016& 2017 outpatient 
   data, duplicates were removed based on enrolid and data were grouped by 5-year age band to align with GBD age pattern. Prevalence ratio was calculated using benign cervical cancer counts 
   over invasive cervical cancer counts within each age group. Result shows younger age groups have larger ratio with wider uncertainty level. This ratio pattern is consistent with a study [Sun-et-al-2010]_ , 
   that is BCC prevalence is higher than ICC prevalence for younger and middle age groups, but the specific ratio values are a little off.
