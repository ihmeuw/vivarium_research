Smoking Related Mortality (Excluding Lung Cancer)
=================================================

Mortality among smokers is much higher than mortality among non-smokers. Therefore, it can be important to consider increased mortality attributable to smoking when smoking is included in a model, even if specific causes affected by smoking are not necessary to explicitly include in the model. See the causal framework section in the :ref:`Vivarium CSU Lung Cancer Screening Concept Model Documentation <2017_concept_model_vivarium_swissre_lungcancer>` for an example of when this is important. 

The purpose of this cause model document is to represent the increased mortality risk associated with smoking exposure by combining the causes affected by the smoking risk factor. This specific cause model document was created to exclude lung cancer so that it can be used in a model that models the lung cancer cause directly.

.. note::

	The starting age group IDs were extracted according to the YLL start, not the YLD start.

	The :ref:`Vivarium CSU Lung Cancer Screening  Model  <2017_concept_model_vivarium_swissre_lungcancer>` only models simulants 15 years (age group ID 8) and older, so notes were made for causes with age group starts older than 15 years only.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

The Vivarium modeling strategy outlined in this document will be a **mortality only** model that combines several causes within GBD. This model is intended to be pair with the :ref:`smoking risk exposure model <2017_risk_exposure_smoking_forecasted>`.

Rather than individual measure the relative risk of mortality due to each individual smoking affected cause to create an overall summary relative risk of mortality due to smoking affected causes, this model will use the all cause mortality PAF for smoking, subtract out the contribution of lung cancer, and then back-calculate a summary relative risk for all smokers (including current and former). 

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assuming a single relative risk of mortality due to all causes except for lung cancer among current and former smokers will underestimate the mortality rate for current smokers with high pack-year exposures and former smokers with low years since quitting and overestimate the mortality rate for current smokers with low pack-year exposures and former smokers with high years since quitting. 

Cause Model Diagram
+++++++++++++++++++

There is no cause model diagram for this cause model because it is a mortality-only model. Mortality using should be modeled as follows:

.. math::

	mr_i = (ACMR - CSMR_\text{c426}) * (1 - PAF_\text{*}) * RR_i + EMR(i)_\text{c426}

     - Defined in :ref:`smoking risk exposure document <2017_risk_exposure_smoking_forecasted>`; can use forecast prevalence. Prior to implementation of smoking risk factor, can use 0.2 as a placeholder.

.. note:: 

  The following shows the proof for the :math:`RR_i` value or current and former smokers:

  1. 

  .. math::

    (ACMR - CSMR_\text{c426}) = (ACMR - CSMR_\text{c426})(1 - PAF_\text{*})(1 - prev_\text{smok}) 

      + (ACMR - CSMR_\text{c426})(1 - PAF_\text{*}) * RR_i * prev_\text{smok}

  2.

  .. math::

    1 = (1 - PAF_\text{*})(1 - prev_\text{smok}) + (1 - PAF_\text{*}) * RR_i * prev_\text{smok}

  3.

  .. math::

    \frac{1}{1 - PAF_\text{*}} = (1 - prev_\text{smok}) * RR_i * prev\text{smok}

  4.

  .. math::

    RR_i = \frac{\frac{1}{1 - PAF_\text{*}} - (1 - prev_\text{smok})}{prev_\text{smok}}

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

The simulation output should replicate the cause-specific mortality rate of smoking affected causes as defined in the data tables. Additionally, GBD all cause mortality should be replicated in the simulation output.
