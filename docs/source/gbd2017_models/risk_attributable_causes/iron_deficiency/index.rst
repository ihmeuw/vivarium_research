Dietary Iron Deficiency (Iron Deficiency Anemia)
================================================

Disease Description
-------------------

Generally, **anemia** is a condition defined by a deficiency of red blood cells
or a deficiency of hemoglobin in the blood. Anemia is typically classified by
hemoglobin concentrations below a defined threshold that varies by age and sex.
Severity of anemia is similarly classified according to ranges of hemoglobin
concentrations. Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and
symptoms of anemia often include weakness, fatigue, and difficulty
concentrating [Kassebaum-et-al-2016]_.

 Notably, anemia may be caused by many diverse factors. Examples of factors
 that may cause anemia include genetic mutations in hemoglobin genes, acute or
 chronic blood loss, altered red blood cell morphology, inadequate nutritional
 intake, and others [Kassebaum-et-al-2016]_.

**Iron deficiency anemia** is a type of anemia that is due to insufficient
iron levels, which lead to a deficiency of hemoglobin in the blood. Notably,
iron deficiency anemia can occur when dietary intake of iron is insufficient,
although it may occur in other situations as well, such as when iron is lost
through bleeding (ex: menstrual disorders, hookworm disease, etc.). Iron
deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia globally in most
populations.

**Dietary iron deficiency anemia** is a specific type of iron deficiency anemia
that is due to inadequate dietary intake of iron, leading to inadequate iron
levels in the body and a subsequent deficiency of hemoglobin in the blood.

Modeling Iron Deficiency in GBD 2017
------------------------------------

In GBD 2017, there is an anemia *impairment* that represents **all** forms of
anemia that are attributable to several causes, including causes such as
hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic anemias that are not considered iron
deficiency anemias.

The dietary iron deficiency *cause* is a population attributable fraction (PAF)
of 1 cause with the iron deficiency risk factor. This means that 100% of the
dietary iron deficiency cases are attributable to the iron deficiency risk
factor. Notably, the iron deficiency risk factor affects maternal disorder
causes, although these relationships are outside of the scope of this document.

Anemia Impairment
+++++++++++++++++

The anemia impairment in GBD 2017 represents the total prevalence of anemia due
to all causes modeled in GBD (ex: dietary iron deficiency anemia, anemia due to
maternal hemorrhage, sickle cell anemia, etc.). Estimating the total prevalence
of the anemia impairment for a given population is the first step in modeling
anemia in GBD 2017. This is done by fitting a distribution of hemoglobin levels
for that population from primary input data based on the population's
hemoclobin concentration mean and standard deviation. For GBD 2017, an ensemble
distribution was used, which was 40% gamma and 60% mirror gumbel.
`Envelope source code <https://stash.ihme.washington.edu/projects/MNCH/repos/anemia/browse/model/envelope>`_.

Once a distribution is fit to hemoglobin levels for a particular age-,
sex-, and location-specific demographic group, the prevalence of anemia (by
severity level) in each group is determined by the WHO hemoglobin thresholds
defined in the following table.

.. _`WHO hemoglobin tresholds table`:

.. note::

	The threshold values in this table are **not** inclusive. For instance, if
	a male less than one month old has a hemoglobin level of exactly 130 g/L,
	he is not considered mildly anemic. If he has a hemoglobin level of 129 g/
	L, he is considered moderately anemic.

The prevalence of anemia as calculated in the process described above serves as
the overall anemia envelope for a age-, sex-, and location-specific demographic
groups, and prevalent cases of anemia in the anemia envelope are then causally
attributed to various causes in GBD 2017 that have anemia as seqeulae. This is
done through a process described in the [GBD-2017-YLD-Appendix-IDA]_. Notably,
the causes iron deficiency anemia, other infectious diseases, other neglected
tropical diseases, other hemoglobinopathies andhemolytic anemias, and other
endorcine, nutrition, blood, and immune disorders are not directly modeled via
the causal attribution process. Rather, these causes were allocated to the
residual anemia envelope following the causal attribution process for all other
anemic causes [GBD-2017-YLD-Appendix-IDA]_. A minimum of 10% of all anemia was
assigned to residual categories (a figure selected based on data from the
United States) [GBD-2017-YLD-Appendix-IDA]_.

Notably, early neonatal and late neonatal age groups (age group IDs 2 and 3)
are excluded from this process; instead, these age groups are assigned the
anemia prevalence from the postneonatal age group (age group ID 4).

Additionally, a pregnancy correction is performed for women of reproductive
age. Therefore, additional considerations beyond the scope of the current
documentation will need to be made if planning to model hemoglobin among women
of reproductive age.

Dietary Iron Deficiency Cause
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The dietary iron deficiency cause in GBD 2017 is 100% attributable to the
iron deficiency risk factor. The dietary iron deficiency cause in GBD is a
YLD-only cause, meaning that it contributes to morbidity, but not mortality.

Modeling Strategy for the Dietary Iron Deficiency Cause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As noted above, the dietary iron deficiency cause in GBD 2017 is not modeled
directly. Rather, it is assigned to a portion of the residual anemia envelope
following causal attribution of other anemic causes.

Cause Hierarchy

.. image:: iron_cause_hierarchy.svg

Health States and Sequela
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sequela associated with the dietary iron deficiency cause in GBD 2017
include mild iron deficiency anemia, moderate iron deficiency anemia, and
severe iron deficiency anemia. The severity of iron deficiency anemia is
determined by the WHO age- and sex- specific hemoglobin concentrations, as
described in the `WHO hemoglobin tresholds table`_.

Iron Deficiency Risk Factor
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In GBD 2017, the iron deficiency risk factor is used for two applications. The
first is the PAF of 1 relationship with the dietary iron deficiency anemia
cause and the second is a risk outcome relationship with maternal disorder
causes.

Notably, the iron deficiency risk factor in GBD 2017 represents the **age-,
sex-, and location-specific mean hemoglobin concentration among the total
population.** The mean value for the iron deficiency risk factor is
stored under modelable entity ID 10487 (also REI ID 95) and the standard
deviation is stored under modelable entity ID 10488. The iron deficiency risk
factor (population hemoglobin concentration) follows a 40% gamma and 60% mirror
Gumbel ensemble distribution.

NOTE:

	The values stored in the iron deficiency risk factor (i.e. population
	hemoglobin concentration parameters) are used in the GBD modeling process
	to calculate risk-deleted population hemoglobin concentration where the
	risk is all iron deficiency (i.e. iron responsive anemias), which serves as
	the population TMREL, in order to calculate the population attributable
	fraction between the iron deficiency risk factor and maternal disorder
	causes. See the GBD 2017 Risk Factor Methods Appendix for more information.
	However, this process is not relevant for the simulation science team use
	of the iron deficiency risk factor as it relates to the dietary iron
	deficiency cause in GBD 2017.

.. note::

	According to the GBD modelers, ESRD - Dialysis, Crohn's disease, and
	ulcerative colitis were also included in this list, although there do not
	appear to be results for these causes in GBD 2017. Additionally, according
	to the GBD modelers, cirrhosis should be included in this list, although
	there do not appear to be any anemia-afflicted sequelae with results in
	GBD 2017 within any of the cirrhosis causes.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Model Scope
+++++++++++

The scope of the Vivarium modeling strategy detailed in this document is to
sample the hemoglobin concentration for an individual simulant (who is not a
woman of reproductive age) and evaluate if that simulant's hemoglobin
concentration will respond to iron supplementation (iron responsive).

The modeling strategy detailed in this document aims to evaluate *all* iron
responsive anemias (collection of causes) rather than the singular cause of 
dietary iron deficiency anemia. However, the modeling strategy described in 
this docuemnt can be modified to include only dietary iron deficiency anemia (
PAF of 1 cause), if desired, by assuming that dietary iron deficiency anemia 
is the only iron responsive cause of anemia, rather than all of the causes 
listed in the `iron responsive anemia causes table`_ and that the dietary iron 
deficiency anemia sequelae are the only iron responsive anemia sequelae in the 
`anemia sequelae IDs table`_.

.. note::

	The Vivarium modeling strategy described here is a strategy to model the
	PAF-of-one GBD cause dietary iron deficiency (attributable to the iron
	deficiency risk factor). The modeling strategy described here does *not*
	consider the realtionship between the GBD iron deficiency risk factor and
	other causes (i.e. maternal disorders).

Initialization
++++++++++++++

At the start of a Vivarium simulation, each simulant must be initalized with
two parameters, including 1) a hemoglobin concentration, and 2) an indicator of
whether the simulant will respond to iron supplementation. Details on how to
intialize these parameters are included in the following sections.

Notably, the initialization of a simulant's hemoglobin concentration should
occur *before* the initialization of iron responsiveness.

.. todo::

  Confirm order in which initialization occurs with research team, and explain
  reasoning. (More simple to assign a hemoglobin concentration based full 
  hemoglobin distribution; bounds are universally between zero and 1. Also 
  fits more easily with propensity score approach.)

Hemoglobin Concentration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to initialize an individual's hemoglobin concentration, each simulant
should be assigned a random number between 0 and 1 (random_number_i). This
number will represent the percentile of hemoglobin concentration for that
individual simulant relative to the baseline population distribution of
hemoglobin concentrations (from the GBD iron deficiency risk factor rei_92)
*for the remainder of the simulation*. The corresponding hemoglobin 
concentration for that percentile should then be assigned to the simulant using 
the methodology described in the reaminder of this section.

Any shifts in hemoglobin concentration (due to baseline coverage or
intervention effects) should be applied *after* an individual's hemoglobin
concentration is sampled from the population distribution as described above.
The post-shift hemoglobin concentration will then act as the simulant's
assigned hemoglobin concentration.

Notably, because the mean and standard deviation for the population hemoglobin
concentration varies by age group, an individual's assigned hemoglobin
concentration will vary as they transition between age groups, although their
assigned *percentile* within that population hemoglobin concentration
distribution will **not** vary as the simulant ages.

The ensemble distribution of population hemoglobin concentrations can be
recreated with the following equations and code:

Iron Responsiveness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As previously discussed, not all anemias in the anemia impairment are iron
deficiency anemias, meaning that not all anemias will respond to iron
supplementation. Therefore, the probability that a simulant with mild,
moderate, or severe anemia (based on their sampled hemoglobin concentration
and WHO anemia threshold values) will respond to iron supplementation/
fortification can be measured by:

.. math::

	\frac{\text{prevalence}_\text{iron responsive anemia}}{\text{prevalence}_\text{total anemia}}

Where *prevalence_iron_responsive_anemia* and *prevalence_total_anemia* are
equal to the severity-, age-, sex-, and location-specific prevalence (from 
COMO) summed across all iron responsive anemia and all total anemia sequela 
IDs, respectively. Sequela IDs for each category are listed in the table below.

Therefore, each simulant should be initialized as either iron responsive (1) or
non-iron responsive (0) according to the following rules:

.. code-block:: Python

	if hb_i < severe_threshold:
		if random_number_i =< prevalence_severe_ira / prevalence_total_severe_anemia:
			iron_responsive_i = 1
		else:
			iron_responsive_i = 0
	elif hb_i < moderate_threshold:
		if random_number_i =< prevalence_moderate_ira / prevalence_total_moderate_anemia:
			iron_responsive_i = 1
		else:
			iron_responsive_i = 0
	elif hb_i < mild_threshold:
		if random_number_i =< prevalence_mild_ira / prevalence_total_mild_anemia:
			iron_responsive_i = 1
		else:
			iron_responsive_i = 0
	else:
		iron_responsive_i = 1

	# NOTE: use <, not =< for anemia thresholds

.. note::

   Final else statement indicates that we assume all individuals without anemia
   will be iron responsive. See calculations that investigate this assumption

Other Model Notes/Strategies

Neonatal Age Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Neonatal age groups should be excluded from the process described in this
document. Simulants should be initialized with a hemoglobin value and an iron
responsiveness indicator at the start of the simulation and/or when they age
into the postneonatal age group (age group ID #4). The reasoning behind this 
is as follows:

1.  GBD did not directly collect data for neonates but instead just copied
    estimates from the post-neonatal age group

2.  The GBD modelers warned us that there might be problems with this
    approach (anemia impairment prevalence will likely not agree with
    anemia prevalence calculated from hemoglobin distribution). Based
    on an initial investigation, the anemia prevalence for the neonatal
    age groups do not validate to GBD anemia impairment prevalence as
    well as for the other under five age groups (see
    `here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_data_analysis/blob/master/pre_processing/iron_deficiency_risk_factor/Hemoglobin%20distribution%20code.ipynb>`__)

3.  We are currently using this model of iron responsive anemia to estimate
    the effect of large-scale food fortification with iron, and we so far
    do not have data to support that neonates' hemoglobin concentrations are affected by their mothers consumption of iron-fortified foods

4.  The neonatal period lasts only 28 days and therefore has a relatively 
	small impact on YLDs and anemia in GBD does not affect mortality among neonates

5.  Since there may be problems with the data, and we don't know whether our
    intervention should affect neonates anyway, the simplest thing is to not
    bother modeling hemoglobin levels in neonates

.. note::

	If upon further investigation the hemoglobin distribution among neonates 
	can be validated to the GBD anemia impairment prevalence and it is 
	applicable for a given simulation/intervention, the model may be adjusted 
	accordingly.

Tracking Years Lived with Disability due to Anemia
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Person time in mild, moderate, and severe anemic states (based on assigned
simulant hemoglobin concentration and age- and sex- specific hemoglobin
thresholds for anemia) should be tracked in the Vivarium simulation and
multiplied by the severity-spefic anemia disability weight to obtain a measure
of YLDs due to anemia in the model. This can be done for all anemia or
iron-responsive anemias (among simulants with iron_responsive_i = 1 only),
depending on model needs (use corresponding anemia prevalences for validation).

Model Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If any causes with anemia health state sequelae are included in the Vivarium
simulation, any disability associated with anemic sequela of that cause will be
counted both through the process described in this document as well as through
the disability weight associated with that cause. The impact of this double
counting should be considered when this is the case before implementation in a
model and recorded as a model limitation if applicable.

Our approach of assigning individual simulants propensity scores (percentiles
within the population hemoglobin concentration distribution) is a limitation of
our modeling strategy in that it assumes that this remains constant over time
and age groups.

We assume that all individuals who are not anemic are iron responsive. This 
assumption is based on two additional assumptions, including a) asymptomatic 
individuals with non-iron-responsive causes will remain asymptomatic, and b) 
the prevalence of individuals with non-iron-responsive causes without anemia 
is neglible (see a notebook investigating the prevalence of these groups
`here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_data_analysis/blob/master/pre_processing/iron_deficiency_risk_factor/Iron%20responsiveness%20among%20the%20non-anemic.ipynb>`__).

	These assumptions may cause our model to improve the hemoglobin status via 
	an iron supplementaion/foritifaction intervention among simulants who may 
	not actually respond to iron supplmentation and otherwise would be 
	borderline non-anemic based on their hemoglobin threshold (and may go on 
	to develop mild anemia as they age and the hemoglobin distribution and 
	anemia threshold values change). Therefore, this assumption may slightly 
	overestimate the impact of iron supplementation/fortification 
	interventions.

Because we are not modeling individual causes of anemia (and their associated
mortality), we assume that all simulants have the same mortality rate 
regardless of their hemoglobin value, when in reality, those with lower 
hemoglobin values will have higher mortality rates than those with higher 
hemoglobin values. Notably, deaths due to causes with iron responsive anemia 
sequelae account for approximately 1.1% of deaths in the first five years of 
life globally (see the calculations `here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_data_analysis/blob/master/pre_processing/iron_deficiency_risk_factor/Anemia%20research%20questions.ipynb>`_).

Because hemoglobin concentrations are not directly modeled among the early and
late neonatal age groups in GBD, the prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe
anemia are assumed to be equal to the prevalence in the post-neonatal age 
group. Therefore, this model is limited when applied to neonatal age groups.

The modeling strategy currently described in this document does not consider
the effect of pregnancy on hemoglobin concentration and therefore is limited in
that is should not be used to model women of reproductive age.

The modeling strategy both as conducted by the GBD modelers and as described in
this document assume a constant shape and standard deviation in the hemoglobin
distribution throughout the modeling process. This is a limitation of our
modeling strategy in that we assume the distribution before a shift is applied
maintains the same shape after a shift due to the intervention is applied.

  Essentially, both the GBD modeling process and our Vivarium implementation
  assume that hemoglobin shifts are constant regardless of an individual's
  starting hemoglobin concentration. The implication is that the shift applies
  uniformly to all individuals regardless of their position in the hemoglobin
  distribution (imagine just pushing a normal distribution to the right, but 
  its shape stays the same). However, we might actually expect the left end of 
  the distribution to get pushed farther than the right end of the 
  distribution in reality, so the shape would change from a normal 
  distribution to a more lop-sided distribution if this were to happen (we 
  assume it doesn't). Note, however, that the the shape is only maintained in 
  our simulation when stratified by iron responsiveness (because 
  non-iron-responsive individuals will not get pushed at all).

Further, the model is limited due to GBD not directly modeling the prevalence
of dietary iron deficiency, which may cause error in the estimation of the
prevalence of this cause.

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

The overall prevalence and YLDs of anemia should be equal between:

- The anemia impairment (rei_192 for all anemia, rei_205 for mild anemia, rei_206 for moderate anemia, and rei_207 for severe anemia)
- The sum across all anemia sequlae (overall and severity-specific)
- The result of anemia prevalence calculated from the population hemoglobin distribution as described in the modeling strategy for prevalence, and prevalence multiplied by the disability weight(s) for YLDs (overall and severity-specific)

The prevalence of anemia using the population hemoglobin distribution can be
calculated using the code below using the parameters defined earlier in this
document and assuming age- and sex- specific *anemia_threshold* values as
defined in the `WHO hemoglobin tresholds table`_ and using the parameters defined in the `population hemoglobin parameters table`_:

.. note::

	The following code has been validated for the age groups and locations 
	relevant to the Large Scale Food fortification project (1 month - 5 years (
	age group IDs 4 and 5) in India, Ethiopia, and Nigeria). See the relevant 
	notebook `here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_data_analysis/blob/master/pre_processing/iron_deficiency_risk_factor/Hemoglobin%20distribution%20code.ipynb>`__.
	However, it requires further validation before application to additional 
	demographic groups, as this method did not validate for all age groups or 
	locations.
