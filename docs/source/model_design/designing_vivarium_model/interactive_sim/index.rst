Intro to Interactive Simulations
--------------------------------

Interactive simulations are a way to step inside of a simulation instead of 
just receiving final outputs. This can be very helpful for a number of tasks 
including V&V, debugging, and generating primary outputs. These are described 
in detail :ref:`below <interactive_tasks>`. 

The interactive sim allows a user to see all of the data available for any simulant. 
For example, in the main simulation you might record the average BMI in the population 
by age and sex. In the interactive simulation, you can see each simulant's individual 
BMI as well as their propensity score for BMI. 

In addition, you can move the simulation forward in time to watch and record how 
simulants change and experience health events. 

However, since we don't parallelize runs in the interactive sim, we tend to use much 
smaller populations and generally only 1 draw and seed combination to limit run time. 
This makes some tasks more difficult to complete interactively. 

.. _interactive_process:

Setting up an Interactive Sim
-----------------------------

Setting up an interactive sim for the first time can be confusing. Follow these 
instructions along with the example notebook included for help. 
Another useful resource is the `Vivarium InteractiveContext documentation <https://vivarium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/interface/interactive.html?highlight=InteractiveContext#vivarium.interface.interactive.InteractiveContext>`_. 

.. _interactive_setup_example:

Example notebook
++++++++++++++++

This `notebook <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_nih_us_cvd/blob/main/interactive_sim_example_setup.ipynb>`_ includes all of the steps seen below using the CVD project as an example. 

.. _interactive_setup_1:

Step 1: General Prep
++++++++++++++++++++

  - Ensure that you have cloned the engineers' GitHub repo and have pulled the latest version of the simulation.  
  - Check that you have `vivarium` installed in your environment and can import `InteractiveContext` in a Jupyter notebook. 
  - If you need more general help with Git or environments for this part, see these :ref:`computing resources <computing>`.
  - Lastly, it is helpful but not required to add code that suppresses warnings generated by the interactive sim. These warnings can add clutter to notebooks and make them difficult to navigate. 

Example code: 

:: 

  import warnings
  warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)
  
  from vivarium import InteractiveContext 

.. _interactive_setup_2:

Step 2: Creating a Simulation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that you're prepped and able to run a simulation, we can actually load the sim! To 
do this, we will use the `InteractiveContext` function in Vivarium. 

First, you'll need to locate the model specs file. It will be in the engineering repo usually 
in a file path similar to: :code:`<project_repo_name>/src/<project_repo_name>/model_specifications/`. 
It will be a .yaml file. 

If you can't locate the proper model specs file or are unsure - ask the engineers for help! 

Once you have that, you can follow this code to create a simulation:

::

  path = Path('<file_path_for_model_spec_file>')
  
  sim = InteractiveContext(path, setup=False)

This creates an object called `sim` that is the simulation. 

.. _interactive_setup_3:

Step 3: Updating the Simulation Parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Often, you will want to use slightly different parameters than are the standard in the model 
spec. For example, you might want to change the population size. To do this, you can use 
`configuration.update`. 

Below is an example of changing the population size from 100,000 in the model spec file 
to be 50,000 for the interactive sim. You can use this to help change anything in the 
`configuration` section of the model spec. 

These are the lines we will be editing as written in the model spec file: 

:: 

  configuration: 
    population: 
      population_size: 100_000
      age_start: 5 
      age_end: 125 

Now, we will update the `population_size` variable to be 50,000 in our notebook: 

::

  sim.configuration.update({
                          'population':
                              {'population_size': 50_000,
                            },
                          })

Instead of using `configuration.update`, you can just directly change the values in the 
model spec file. However, since this file exists in the engineering repo, changing it on 
your local machine can cause errors and confusion. Therefore, we do NOT recommend this 
approach. 

Below, in the :ref:`examples section<interactive_tasks>` we talk about making more 
substantial changes to the simulation - turning observers on and off or removing 
components of the sim. The approach outlined here only works for changes within the `configuration` 
section of the model spec, so to make larger edits you will need to edit the model spec file 
directly. Information on how to handle this is provided in the examples below. 

.. _interactive_setup_4:

Step 4: Loading Data from the Simulation 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that you have the parameters set up, you're ready to start getting data from the simulation. 
The first step is to run `sim.setup`. Running this command will take some time and possibly generate 
some pink warning text. Don't worry! Just wait for the cell to finish running. 

Once it's done, you will have a simulated population. You can use `get_population` to create a dataset 
with your population. Some simulant data automatically gets recorded for your sim. To find a list of these, 
list the columns in your dataset. Other simulant data does not automatically get added, but can also 
be saved. To find a list of additional sim data available, use `list_values`. If you find 
something from the list that you want included in your data, just add it using `get_value`. 

The below will show using all of these in practice: 

:: 

  sim.setup() # Sets up the simulation 

  pop0 = sim.get_population() # Generates a dataset with some simulant data included 
  pop0.columns # Lists the columns in your simulant dataset 
  sim.list_values() # Lists the additional columns you can add to the dataset 

  # Pulls in new data for all simulants and adds it to a dataframe 
  data1 = pd.concat([pop0,
                   sim.get_value('<item_in_list_values>')(pop0.index),
                   ], axis=1)
  data1.head()

.. _interactive_setup_5:

Step 5: Taking a Step Forward 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The above steps only include a base population. You can also run the simulation forward 
by taking time steps. The most popular way to do this is using the 'step' function. This 
function takes a single step forward in the simulation. Most commonly, researchers will 
take a single step, record needed information and then take another step. An example 
of this is in the notebook below. 

There are other methods to run a simulation forward which are shown in the docstring 
above such as `run_for` and `run_until`. These are designed to run the simulation forward 
without recording data. These can be useful for burn-in periods. 

Code example: 

:: 

  sim.step() 

The example notebook at the top expands on this to include an example of how to track simulant 
data over time and record subsequent time steps.

You might notice that in a lot of the tasks above, especially making primary output graphs, 
you will make new "observers" for the sim and then run time forward, capturing this 
additional data. You might ask yourself, why not just make those the built-in observers 
to my actual sim? The answer is that the "dimensions" of complexity of a model run 
combine multiplicatively, so it is super expensive to do all of them at once. For example, 
you can run the simulation with 60 draws and simple observers, and you can run an 
interactive sim with 1 draw and complicated observers, but 60 draws and complicated 
observers takes way more resources than adding up those two runs. Therefore we sometimes 
choose to make plots in the interactive sim instead! 

.. _interactive_challenges:

Common Challenges
-----------------

Using the interactive sim is fundamentally different than looking at simulation outputs 
and this can lead to challenges. Because you are running a mini-simulation on your computer, 
you overlap a lot more with engineering workflow and have to watch out for some common pitfalls.

1. Using the correct branch and simulation version: 

To run an interactive sim, you usually clone the simulation repository and then perform
an `editable install <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs>`_
(:code:`pip install -e .`), which means you are running exactly the code you have in your cloned repository.
More information on this can be found in the :ref:`set-up guide above <interactive_setup_1>`.

Be sure that you are pulling from the engineering repo as needed. If you forget, the latest work 
might not be present in your version of the sim, leading to confusion. 

If you need to look at an old version of the sim or are actively debugging something, you might 
not work from the main branch. Work with engineering to ensure you're on the correct branch for 
your needed task. 

This can be especially challenging if you need to use different branchs of upstream repos, like 
vivarium or vivarium public health. If you run into this type of situation, consult with the 
engineers to find the best strategy to move forward. 

2. Editing engineering files on your local clone: 

In some cases, you might make edits to the model files on your local copy of the code. This might be to 
remove certain observers, or model components. While small changes like population or 
scenario can be done in a notebook, removing components cannot. 

Be careful!! While it's fine to make edits you need, don't push them to the engineering repo. 
Also, track the edits so if you have to pull a new model version from engineering, you can reset 
the interactive sim to how you need. 

If you are making edits on your local copy, be sure to write down what changes you make in the 
notebook so you can refer back to it later. Also consider using :code:`git stash` and 
:code:`git stash apply` to save and reapply changes. 

3. Differing environments: 

Engineers create their own environments, and might use different versions of packages or 
of Python than you are using. This can cause confusion if something isn't running as 
expected.

If you created your environment a while ago and you think you might have gotten out of sync,
you should try re-running the :code:`pip install -e .` command in the engineering repo or
re-creating the environment entirely. If you're not sure what version of Python to use, 
ask the engineers what they are using.
