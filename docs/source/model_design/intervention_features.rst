Interventions critical features
===============================

.. note::

   This  template aims at making sure basic aspects of an intervention are understood and written out so that the SWE team has a clear idea of expectations and the Researchers and SWEs do not need to go back and forth about clarifying these details throughout the project. Questions we need to answer about intervention early in research process (to be agreed upon with the client):

1. Research aims and objections
-------------------------------

.. note::

	1. write a one sentence aim
	-What does the client want to learn, specifically?
	eg. To evaluate the effect of different interventions of population-wide nutritional fortification of staple foods on disability-adjusted life years in children under 5 in India, Nigeria, and Pakistan.

	2. Write a few SMART objectives, answering one question per objective
	*Think about* What are they willing to ignore? Is GBD/Vivarium able to answer these questions well? How might we adapt our questions to questions that GBD can answer?

	eg. Research Q1: To quantify the what-if scenario of increasing coverage of vitamin A from exiting to X% on under 5 childhood mortality and morbidity.

	eg. Research Q2: To quantify the what-if scenario of increasing coverage of folic acid from exiting to X% on under 5 childhood mortality and morbidity

2. Outcomes the intervention affects
------------------------------------

3. Effect sizes and definitions
-------------------------------

.. note::

	What are the exposure and control groups?
	What is the definition of the effect size (prevalence or incidence or mortality, etc.)
	Units of effect size(s) for intervention
	Shifts or RRs? Is this compatible with GBD risk factor distribution/definition? Can we convert or find alternative data source if not?
	Do we need to alter our units on GBD side (using cross-walks) or intervention data source side?
	NOTE: we need to understand the GBD structure for the relevant risk/cause enough to determine compatibility with our intervention effect sizes


4. Potential confounders and mediators
--------------------------------------

.. note::
	What are they?
	Might we need to control for them?

5. Limitations
--------------
