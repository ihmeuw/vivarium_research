BLISS Style Guide
==================

Building Language Inclusivity into Simulation Science (BLISS) is an important part of
our team's work! Here you will find our ongoing style guide for incorporating inclusive 
language into our day-to-day work.

For those on the simulation science team or not - if you are setting out to do some research 
that somehow touches on sex and gender and  you aren’t sure how to proceed with methods and 
results, this should be exactly what you need!

1.0 Overview 
++++++++++++
As part of our team and organization's larger DEI efforts, we are committed to researching
and building a style guide so as to incorporate inclusive language into our day-to-day work
and to address the harmful conflation of sex and gender in public health research and data. 
We hope this page will serve as a useful guide to members of the Simulation Science team as
well as other teams at IHME!

On this page you will find our guiding principles, a glossary of commonly used terms related
to BLISS, recommendations for how to address sex/gender-related limitations in external data
sources, discussion of the implications of imperfect proxy measures with regards to sex/gender,
examples of how our team has incorporated BLISS into our work process, and more!

1.1 Guiding Principles
----------------------

Our guiding principles for this document can be summarized in three points:  

**1. This work is important**

Inclusive language use is important, and we want to begin by acknowledging the 
potential harm that using gendered language can create. ‘Sex’ and ‘gender’ are 
not synonymous, unidimensional traits. [Bauer_2022]_ acknowledges this and explains 
how common sex and gender proxies such as chromosomes or sex organs are imperfect 
and not fully inclusive of lived experiences.  

Using imperfect proxies and gendered language can create harm by alienating individuals, and by 
creating invalid research. People who are intersex, transgender, nonbinary, and/or 
have other gender-nonconforming identities experience harm from gendered language in a 
number of ways, including documented reductions in interactions 
with healthcare, not being included in research, and lost 
opportunities. In an effort to work toward institution-wide DEI goals and 
advance our team’s research and publications, we created this guide to explore the 
concepts of sex and gender and offer inclusive language alternatives.  

One example of how proxy measures can affect the validity of research is in [Bauer_2022]_, 
where researchers used 'women' as a proxy for people with a uterus. The researchers were 
trying to find the incidence of uterine cancer, but by using 'women' as the denominator, 
even though not all women have a uterus, cancer rates were thought to be lower than was true 
in real life. This was especially prominent for Black women who are more likely to have had 
a hysterectomy. This example highlights the importance of using a measure that is actually 
tied to the research question.  

A second example of the potential impact on research validity is equating differences in 
results to only sex or gender. As explained in [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_, both sex and gender 
can lead to biological changes and untangling these pathways is complex or impossible. Often, 
researchers will report findings as "sex differences," implying that they are a result of sex, 
without exploring the role of gendered behavior or norms. 

Lastly, we hope to inspire change in other researchers by presenting our studies with gender 
inclusive language and model practices we believe in. For all of these reasons, we feel this 
guide is very important.  

**2. This work is evolving**

Language is constantly evolving, so there is rarely a single “right” choice and the accepted 
choice may evolve over time. Therefore, this guide will be a living document that we will 
regularly review and update. We will hold ourselves accountable for aligning the guide with 
the current preferred language, terminology and approaches.  

While we hope this can be up-to-date and comprehensive, no guide can anticipate every use case, 
recognize every limitation, or be applicable to every research question. We aim to provide enough 
information that users can understand the spirit of the guide and apply that to their unique needs.  

**3. This is work**

We acknowledge that there is a cost associated with a transition to gender inclusive language 
practices from standard, gendered language. Although using gender inclusive language is work, 
we highlight here that there are many benefits to incorporating more inclusive language into 
everyday public health research practices.  

Gender inclusive language can often be longer or more verbose than gendered language, but we 
believe specificity is more important than brevity. We seek to include all groups and identities 
in our language, even if that means using more words! For example, we would rather use terms like 
"women and people" to describe pregnancy related issues since this is inclusive of all who can get 
pregnant while not invisibilizing women.

The ever-evolving nature of the work means that this guide is for everyone! You don’t have to be 
an expert; this is meant to be accessible for all people. Wherever you are in the learning 
journey, this guide is intended to be a clear, helpful resource.  

We’re not going to put any words into other people’s mouths, but we will use our own voice to do 
the work and use the terms we find most accurate and inclusive.  

1.2 Glossary of General Terminology
-----------------------------------
In this section, you will find a glossary of general terminology that will be used 
throughout this style guide. 


.. list-table:: **Glossary**
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Term
     - Definition
   * - Sex
     - *Sex* refers to biological attributes and functions associated with chromosomal makeup, 
       reproductive anatomy, and secondary sex characteristics [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_.
   * - Gender
     - *Gender*, on the other hand, is a social construct that refers to the culturally specific 
       expectations, behaviors, and institutions that shape any individual's access to power, 
       privilege, and resources. It can also refer to a gendered individual's internal sense of 
       identity [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_.
   * - Undifferentiated sex/gender measure
     - Undifferentiated sex/gender measure is a variable that indicates uncertainty 
       regarding what is being reported. This uncertainty can arise  due to unclearly defined variables 
       in an external data source (e.g., vague survey question that different respondents may interpret differently) 
       or from the compilation of many data sources with clear definitions of 'sex' or 'gender' into one 
       conglomerate sex/gender variable (e.g., GBD "sex" variable).
   * - Sex- and gender-related factors
     - An umbrella term that refers to any and all characteristics related to sex and/or gender (e.g., 
       gamete size, hormone production, reproductive or sexual anatomy, so-called 'secondary sex
       characteristics' such as body hair or breast tissue, gender identity, gender expression, risk-taking behavior, etc). 
   * - Proxy measure
     - "An indirect measure of the desired outcome which is itself strongly correlated to that outcome" [GovEx_Johns_Hopkins]_.
       Unacknowledged use of a proxy measure for the output variable of interest can lead to inaccurate
       or harmful findings and should therefore be approached with caution. For example, [Bauer_2022]_
       discusses in their paper how the "unacknowledged use of a sex/gender proxy for a sexed dimension of interest
       (i.e., uterine status) resulted in decades of cancer research misestimating risks, racial disparities,
       and age trends".
   * - Sex assigned at birth
     - "Recorded on initial birth record; generally genital phenotype" [Bauer_2022]_.
   * - Intersex status
     - "Reported presence of intersex conditions generally or a specific condition" [Bauer_2022]_. 
   * - Gender identity
     - "Personally held sense of one’s gender as man/boy, woman/girl, another cultural gender, 
       trans, nonbinary, etc." [Bauer_2022]_.
   * - Intersex identity
     - "Personally held identification as intersex" [Bauer_2022]_.
   * - Sexual and gender minority (SGM) 
     - An umbrella term that includes (but is not limited to) individuals that are two-spirit, 
       intersex, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, asexual, or have other gender 
       non-conforming identities.

2.0 Research question
+++++++++++++++++++++

As much as possible, our research should be precise about the variables of interest.
For example, if we are modeling pregnancy, the variable we are interested in is the
ability to become pregnant.
This not only clarifies that we are interested in biological sex and not gender, but is even
more precise that it is this facet of biological sex that matters,
not another facet such as chromosomal makeup.

It is frequently not possible to be this precise;
we should try to at least determine whether our research question is about sex or gender.
In some cases, even this may not be clear, for example if we are researching an
association that could be mediated by either sex or gender (or both), making them both
variables of interest.

2.1 Define your proxy measure
-----------------------------

When our input data does not include a variable of interest, we are forced to use
**proxy measures**.
A proxy measure is another variable that is highly correlated with the variable of interest,
which we use as a stand-in for it.
In the pregnancy example, we might use as a proxy whether `someone was assigned female sex at birth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment>`_
and is between the ages of 15 and 50.
This is an imperfect proxy for the ability to become pregnant because some people in this group
are not able to become pregnant (e.g. due to having had a hysterectomy) and in rare cases
someone may be able to become pregnant who is not in this group (e.g. due to inaccuracy in sex assignment at birth).

Whenever we use a proxy measure, we introduce a limitation into our research,
which we should acknowledge explicitly.
These limitations could lead to harm if they informed incorrect conclusions that
resulted in real-world decisions or policies.
This harm would be especially likely to impact those for whom the proxy measure and the
underlying variable of interest are not the same.
For example, if we use gender as a proxy measure for sex,
the people most likely to be left out of our conclusions are transgender, non-binary,
and intersex people.
We should always weigh these harms against the potential benefits of the research
before deciding to use a proxy measure.

3.0 Data collection
+++++++++++++++++++

Our research doesn't generally involve primary data collection.
Therefore, the *input* data to our modeling process is almost always
the *output* of other research, such as a survey, which we don't have
control over.

A lot of the time, we are multiple steps removed from the original data.
For example, many of our models use Global Burden of Disease (GBD) outputs.
These outputs are the result of a modeling process which itself
uses published results from primary research.
GBD is a little bit special in that we have a pretty good understanding of
its inner workings; see the GBD-specific section below.

Frequently, upstream research does not report sex and/or gender in ways that
reflect the difference between, and complexity of, those concepts.
Since we are stuck with whatever is reported, we have to decide
both how to use the variables reported in our analysis, and how to acknowledge
the limitations introduced to our research by these issues in our
research outputs (presentations, reports, etc).

3.1 Sex and gender variables in upstream research 
-------------------------------------------------

**We should not take the names of sex or gender variables in input data at
face value.**
Due to prevalent misunderstandings of sex and gender as distinct and complex concepts,
these variables are very likely to be mislabeled.

Instead, we should trace these variables back to their source when it is
feasible to do so.
For example, if we are using data from a survey, we should find the actual survey
questions asked to respondents.

Sometimes, doing this investigation will make it clear that the variable
is an accurate reflection of either sex or gender.
In fact, it may be an even more precise measure, such as the presence of a Y chromosome
(a characteristic that is one facet of biological sex) or gender *identity* (as opposed
to expression).
Unfortunately, however, the most common outcome of this investigation will be to find
that sex and gender were conflated and/or restricted to a binary.
For example, a survey question that simply asks "are you male or female?" may be
interpreted by some respondents as asking about sex and by other respondents as asking
about gender.
Non-binary people who interpret it as a gender question, and intersex people who interpret
it as a sex question, will not see themselves represented in the answer choices.
They may not respond at all, or they may inaccurately choose one of the
binary categories.

When it is not feasible to trace a sex or gender variable back to its source,
either because we are many steps removed from the original data or because
there is a lack of public documentation about a data source,
**we should assume that it is a non-differentiated sex/gender measure,**
unless there are clear signs of effort to construct a valid sex/gender measure.
Unfortunately, given current research practices, it is most common that a single binary variable
labeled either "gender" or "sex" actually represents a non-differentiated sex/gender measure.

3.2 Measurement error
---------------------

In the evaluation of sex and/or gender as a variable in an epidemiologic study, error in
the measurement of these variables can lead to bias in study results. Measurement error
may be introduced through researchers assuming participants' gender rather than self-reporting,
or not asking questions in a way that allows participants to accurately report their sex
and/or gender.

In situations where sex and/or gender are being treated as an exposure variable relative to
some outcome (for instance, in a research question such as "what influence does sex have on
a given outcome?"), measurement error will bias the measure of effect, and the direction of 
the bias depends on whether or not the measurement error is differential or non-differential
with respect to the outcome. Each case is described below:

- Non-differential measurement error of the exposure is when the amount of exposure 
  misclassification does not vary by outcome level. In this case, the measure of effect of the
  exposure on the outcome will be biased towards the null.

- Differential measurement error of the exposure occurs when the amount of exposure 
  misclassification varies by the outcome level. For instance, a study design in which gender was
  ascertained from recorded sex in medical records for lung cancer cases, but was self-reported
  among control participants is likely to have differential rates of measurement error of gender
  by case versus control status. In this situation, the measure of effect of the exposure on the 
  outcome may be biased upwards or downwards.

In either case, measurement error of sex and/or gender can lead to biased results and care 
should be taken to minimize error in measuring these variables (as for all variables!) to 
minimize bias in study results. When we are using data published by others, it is important
to consider how results may be affected by potential measurement error and dicuss any
relevant limitations accordingly.

4.0 Methods 
+++++++++++

4.1 Terminology
---------------

When we determine that a variable in an input data source reflects something different
than the name it was given by the upstream researchers, we should use the more
accurate terminology wherever possible, even when talking specifically about that
data source.

The only exception to this is that we should unambiguously state, somewhere in our
research outputs, the variable name we used from the input data file.
This should only need to be mentioned once.
This promotes clarity and reproducibility by ensuring that readers can find the
data we used.

For example, the first time we mentioned the sex/gender variable of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
in the appendix of the VEHSS diabetic retinopathy paper: [VEHSS_DR]_

.. pull-quote::

  NHANES data report a variable named “gender,” but... [description of limitations]

  As such, this variable is best understood as a
  non-differentiated sex/gender measure, a proxy measure for both sex and gender that does
  not directly measure either.
  Hereafter, we refer to this variable as “sex/gender” to reflect
  this limitation.

Because we are deviating from the language of the upstream research authors, it is
a good idea to (concisely) justify why we think the original authors' language was inaccurate.
In the NHANES example, the full first sentence of the above quote was:

.. pull-quote::
  NHANES data report a variable named “gender,” but this reflects a survey question, “Is
  {NAME} male or female?,” which only allowed binary responses, was only asked by the
  interviewer if they hadn't already assumed the gender of the respondent, and could be
  interpreted as asking about biological sex.

4.2 GBD
-------

.. todo::
  Describe the best methodology/terminology for working with the "sex" variable from GBD

5.0 Results
+++++++++++

As mentioned above, before beginning our research, we should determine the variables
of interest: the facets of gender and/or sex that we expect to be most directly associated with
our outcome.
If it isn't possible to narrow this down or distinguish what might be important, we can consider
all gender- and sex-related factors to be variables of interest.

When we present our findings, we have two goals:

* Accurately convey what associations we are looking for, and what the causal structures might be.
  We should strive to be as precise as possible, and not rely on "common sense"
  to indicate which gender- and sex-related factors are related to a health outcome.
  Despite prevailing belief that sex affects gender but not vice versa, there is
  strong evidence for causal influence in both directions. [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_ [Springer_2012]_
  Even when we do think that a sex-related factor is most proximal to our outcome,
  we should still mention that some of its impact could be mediated through
  gender factors and that it is difficult to disentangle these.
* Highlight data limitations around sex and gender measures.
  We don't want our inclusive language to give the impression that we are able to make accurate
  conclusions about sexual and gender minority populations when the data prevents us from doing this.
  Furthermore, drawing attention to the problems with how almost every data source currently
  captures sex and/or gender raises awareness that changes need to be made in primary data collection.

In this section, we make some suggestions about language to use in external
communications when discussing findings (papers, talks, etc).

5.1 Initial Description of Results
----------------------------------

Before the first time a gender- or sex-related result is presented,
we should:

- Name the gender- and sex-related factors our result pertains to, if clear.
  If unclear (which is most of the time), call out the difficulty of disentangling factors
  from each other, to prevent readers from jumping to the conclusion that it's always
  biological factors that are important.
- Acknowledge data limitations and proxy measures used.
- Call for better data to be collected.

Let's consider the example of reporting a result about pregnancy.
In this case, while gender-related factors could play a role in e.g. pregnancy outcomes,
the sex- or gender-related factor with the most direct relevance is clearly the ability
to become pregnant.
In this case, we might say:

.. pull-quote::

  In health research on pregnancy, it is important to identify the group
  of people who can become pregnant.
  Typically, a proxy measure of "women of reproductive age" is constructed for
  this purpose, combining some indicator of female sex or gender with an age restriction
  such as 15-49 years.
  This measure does not account for infertility, for example by including people who
  have had hysterectomies.
  Additionally, when it is defined in a way that conflates sex with gender,
  it will be highly inaccurate among transgender people and other gender minority populations.

  To be more precise and inclusive in our language, we define our population of interest as
  women and birthing people of reproductive age (WBPRA): people ages 15-49 who were assigned
  female sex at birth.
  Note that this definition retains the limitation about infertility.

  Sex assigned at birth was not measured in any of our data sources,
  so we used proxy measures for this attribute.
  Notably, <source> and <source> only provided undifferentiated sex/gender measures,
  making it unclear how our conclusions generalize to transgender people and other gender minority populations.
  Due to these issues, our results are among WBPRA according to imperfect proxy measures.
  To address these limitations, data would need to be collected using more robust measures
  of sex- and gender-related factors. [Bauer_2017]_ [Nielsen_2021]_ [ABS_2021]_ [National_Academies_2022]_

On the other hand, if we were doing descriptive epidemiology and didn't have even an educated
guess of what specific sex- and gender-related factors could be associated with our outcome:

.. pull-quote::

  Sex and gender are multi-dimensional concepts.
  Collectively, they span a number of biological (sex-related) and sociocultural
  (gender-related) factors which are highly correlated and causally entangled with one other. [Bauer_2022]_ [Springer_2012]_
  Frequently in health research, differences are attributed wholly to sex-related factors, when
  in fact gender-related factors also play a part in those differences. [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_ [Springer_2012]_
  For example, gender-associated behaviors such as care-seeking and risk-taking can influence
  health outcomes,
  and structural or interpersonal sexism or cisnormativity can influence the quality of preventive health
  care received.
  Since prevalence of <outcome> could be influenced by sex- and/or gender-related factors,
  an ideal analysis would report prevalence by multiple of these factors.

  However, each data source used in this study reported only a single sex or gender variable,
  and many of these were binary as well as undifferentiated.
  Therefore, we have used each of these variables as proxies for the entire group of
  sex- and gender-related factors, and are only able to report prevalence in "male" and "female"
  groups.
  It is unclear how our conclusions would generalize to transgender people and other gender minority
  populations.
  To address these limitations, data would need to be collected using more robust measures
  of sex- and gender-related factors. [Bauer_2017]_ [Nielsen_2021]_ [ABS_2021]_ [National_Academies_2022]_

5.2 Further Results (Text, Figures, Tables)
-------------------------------------------

Of course, it is not possible to include a long explanation each and every time sex- or
gender-related concepts are referenced.
After an initial, comprehensive description, we have to switch to some kind of shorthand.

The most important things to keep in mind when choosing this shorthand are:

- If the full term includes both sex and gender, both should appear in it in some way
  -- using only one or the other invites the reader to jump to conclusions.
- Likewise, we should not use the basic terms "males" and "females" or "men" and "women"
  when we are reporting a concept that is more complex than correctly-measured sex or gender alone.
- If the full term includes an acknowledgement that results are based on proxy measures,
  that should be preserved, or at least nodded to, in the shorthand.

.. todo::

  Give concrete recommendations for shorthand in common situations (e.g. proxy for all sex- and gender-related factors)

To continue the two examples from the previous section, the pregnancy example might use this shorthand:

.. pull-quote::
  
  ... our results are among WBPRA according to imperfect proxy measures,
  henceforth "proxy WBPRA."

  ... the fertility rate was 14 per 1,000 person-years among proxy WBPRA ...

while the descriptive epidemiology example might use this:

.. pull-quote:: 

  ... we estimate that prevalence was 7.8% among people with a "male" proxy value for sex- and gender-related factors ...

.. todo::
  This should be shorter!

6.0 BLISS in Action 
+++++++++++++++++++

Our team has been able to implement these BLISS guidelines in our own work. 
Here we chronicle guides, papers and presentations that include BLISS best 
practices, as well as some lessons learned. 

6.1 Examples of Our Work with BLISS
-----------------------------------

#. A `BLISS guide for Topics Concerning Pregnancy <https://uwnetid.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ihme_simulation_science_team/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3E09642A-1A84-4D63-8690-EDA98E611295%7D&file=202204_Gender%20Neutral%20Language%20for%20Topics%20concerning%20Pregnancy.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true>`_. This includes recommendations on gender inclusive language that can be used for topics of pregnancy and child birth. 
#. A presentation about IV iron at the `Institute of Disease Modeling symposium <https://uwnetid.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ihme_simulation_science_team/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B141E4585-6A1B-414C-8DDE-2F075FEB1667%7D&file=20230501_IDM_Symposium_DRAFT_v0.2.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true>`_. This presentation included many of the terms from our pregnancy guide implemented in practice.
#. A paper on the `prevalence of diabetic retinopathy <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/article-abstract/2806093>`_ that includes a "nondifferentiated sex and gender measure" for data analysis and helpful explanation of what that means with respect to the specific primary data sources used. 



6.2 Lessons Learned
-------------------

- Most people are willing and even enthusiastic about improving language to be more gender inclusive! 
- Changing language requires an explanation. It is important to explain the new language, why it is important and what it means.
- In situations where using gender-inclusive language changes established practices or definitions in the field (e.g., maternal mortality is a commonly understood term), we must take extra care to not confuse our audience and ensure all are able to understand and benefit from our work. 
- As secondary data analyzers, we are limited by the data we can find and the information included about its collection. As much as we want to, it it often impossible to decide if a variable represents sex or gender or who in a dataset might be being missed, or misclassified. 
- Acknowledging these limitations and considering their impact is an important part of this work.
