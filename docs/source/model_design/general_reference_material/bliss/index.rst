Building Language Inclusivity into Simulation Science
=====================================================

Building Language Inclusivity into Simulation Science (BLISS) is an important part of
our team's work! Here you will find our ongoing guide for incorporating inclusive 
language regarding people's identities into your day-to-day work.

For those on the Simulation Science team or not - if you are setting out to do some research 
that somehow touches on sex and gender or race and ethnicity, and you arenâ€™t sure how to proceed
with methods and results, this should be exactly what you need!


1.0 Overview 
++++++++++++
As part of our team and organization's larger DEI efforts, we are committed to researching
and building a guide to incorporate inclusive language into our day-to-day work
and to address the harmful conflation and oversimplification
of dimensions of identity in health metrics research and data. As of March 2024, we have drafted an 
Inclusive Health Metrics guide for sex and gender, and are currently working on a similar
guide for race and ethnicity. We hope these pages will serve as a useful guide to members 
of the Simulation Science team as well as other teams at IHME!
