.. todo::

  Determine if it is necessary to have an initialized population of U5 year olds at the start of the simulation. Doing so will be helpful to maintain continuity in the way that we assign LBWSG exposure for simulants who are born into the sim and those who are initialized into the sim, but would require post-processing transformations to measure total DALYs among children under five in the beginning years of the simulation (although we would have an accurate measure of DALYs averted). Alternative strategies include a five year burn-in period (long) or discontinitous assignment of LBWSG among the initialized population (which would be harder for the software engineers, but especially with a month long burn-in period would seem to have a small impact on model results).

[1] underestimation of diarrheal diseases and lower respiratory infections remission rates. [2] underestimation of lower respiratory infections burden in neonatal age groups. [3] GBD 2019 age groups (does not include new GBD 2020 age groups). NOTE: still need to validate DALYs, YLLs, YLDs once environment issue is solved.

  :header-rows: 1

  * - Issue
    - Explanation
    - Action plan
    - Timeline
  * - Underestimation of diarrheal diseases and LRI remission rates
    - Potential timestep issue, as identified with CIFF
    - Researchers to investigate solutions
    - TBD
  * - Underestimation of LRI burden in neonatal age groups
    - Appears to be a result of incompatible incidence, remission, and prevalence as estimated by GBD. There was birth prevalence of LRI in GBD 2017 that was removed for GBD 2019. Including a birth prevalence in our model would allow us to validate to GBD metrics, but would be inconsistent with GBD assumptions.
    - Researchers to determine which validation targets are most important to hit and strategize how to achieve that.
    - TBD
  * - GBD 2019 age groups
    - Model is using GBD 2019 age groups rather than GBD 2020 age groups, which will be needed if we plan to use GBD 2020 CGF risk factors
    - Researchers to determine if we would like to update to GBD 2020 or stick with GBD 2019
    - TBD
