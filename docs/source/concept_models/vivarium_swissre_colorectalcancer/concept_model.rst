1.1 Project overview
--------------------
This project will generate forecasts of colon and rectum cancer prevalence, 
incidence, and cause-specific mortality to allow Swiss Re to identify trends 
that are important to its business decision-making. IHME will produce both a 
baseline (business as usual) forecast, and an alternative scenario forecast 
in which key colon and rectum cancer screening practice is implemented in a 
simulation framework. Baseline forecasts will incorporate expected trends in 
relevant risk factors. Alternative scenario forecasts will incorporate baseline 
forecasts and the expected impact of screening technologies. All forecasts will 
represent the Swiss Reâ€™s insured population from the weighted blend of Chinese 
provinces. Forecasts will be from year 2020 to 2040.

2.0 Modeling aims and objectives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To help SwissRe identify pay-out trends for colon and rectum cancer claims, 
IHME will estimate the yearly number of cases of colon and rectum cancer 
detected (per 100,000 insured person-years) via colon and rectum cancer 
screening and symptomatic presentation in a baseline with no screening scale-up 
and an alternativein in which screening scaled-up.

4.1 Simulation scenarios
------------------------
Baseline: project existing level of colon and rectum cancer screening for 
simulants aged 50 to 74 years, where:
 - Medium-risk group are provided with FOBT (fecal occult blood test) 
   every year
 - High-risk group (with family history of colon and rectum cancer or 
   personal history of adenoma) are provided colonoscopy every 5 years

Alternative scenario: by 2040, linear ramp up colon and rectum cancer screening 
to cover 60% of women aged 50 to 74 years in 2030, then keep 60% coverage till 
2040, where:
 - Medium-risk group are provided with FOBT (fecal occult blood test) 
   every year
 - High-risk group (with family history of colon and rectum cancer or 
   personal history of adenoma) are provided colonoscopy every 5 years

.. note::

 - Lin et al. reported an uptake rate of 15.4% for colorectal cancer screening 
   among Chinese adults in Guangzhou. In this study, the screening update rate 
   varies by age and sex, but less likely associated with residence of urban and 
   rual. Temporarily, let's use 20% as baseline screening coverage across all 
   ages and sexes for SwissRe's insured population.
 - We assume that the screenig uptake rate in China is 20 years behind the US; 
   therefore, we will use the documented number in 2010 among US general 
   population to determine the target screening coverage in China. In 2008, 
   51.6% of american adults were up-to-date with CRC screening. From 2008 to 
   2010, screening rates increased by 6.7 percentage points to 58.3%. Although 
   CRC rates were essentially unchanged from 2010 to 2013 (58.3% to 57.3%), they 
   increased an additional four percentage points to 61.3% between 2013 and 
   2015. [de-Moor-et-al-2018]_

5.3.2 Screening and detection model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`I. Screening algorithm`

Colon and rectum cancer screening algorithm was determined by three variables:
 1) Age
 2) Family history of colon and rectum cancer
 3) Personal history of adenoma

People met any of following criteria are considered high-risk for colon and 
rectum cancer screening:
 - With family history of colon and rectum cancer
 - With personal history of adenoma

Positive for FOBT does not necessarily mean you have colorectal cancer

     - Both
     - Any risk level
     - No screening
     - N/A
     - N/A
     - N/A

.. note::
 
  - There are studies suggest an earlier colon and rectum cancer screeening 
    starts from age of 40 years for high-risk population.
  - One or two negative examinations of colonoscopy may signal lifetime protection 
    against CRC. We should confirm with cancer experts whether we want to 
    discontinue screening for those who had negative results of prior colonoscopy.

In initialization, We assume that
 - No one has prior knowledge of their disease status on day 1 of the simulation.
 - All simulants are buying insurance on day 1 of the simulation.
 - For simulants in clinical (C) state regardless of detection, they have a 
   transition rate of 0.1 (per person-year) of moving into a recovered (R) state; 
   People in state C and R follow exactly the same screening algorithm, namely 
   branch A, B, and C depending on their age and risk level. Negative screening 
   results are expected for those in R state in order to avoid double counting 
   the CI claim from detected colon and rectum cancer.

:underline:`II. Screening schedule and attendance`

Probability of attending screening
 - Generate 1000 draws from normal distribution with mean of `current screening 
   coverage` (e.g., 0.2 for baseline), SD of `1% of current screening coverage` 
   (e.g., 0.002 for baseline) for calculating the probability of simulants 
   attending their first due screening.
 - If a simulant attended their last screening, they have {X} more odds of
   attending the next screening than those who did not attend their last screening.

:underline:`III. Screening initialization`

The date of the first screening appointment (T_appt) for simulants at age between 
50 and 75 is determined as follows. We assume that each simulant had a previous 
appointment scheduled at some point before the simulation begins. We calculate 
the time between that past appointment and their next appointment (delta_T) 
using the methodology outlined in Section 5.3.2.II (Time to next scheduled 
screening). With a uniform distribution we randomly determine how far along 
that time interval between appointments each individual is (X) at the beginning 
of the simulation (T_0). For simulants under 50, the methodology is identical 
when the simulation begins, except T_0 is the simulant's 50th birthday rather 
than the beginning of the simulation. No screening appointment will be initialized 
for simulants at any age above 65.

.. _7.0:

7.0 Limitations
+++++++++++++++
 1. Adenoma will be modeled as a risk factor rathern than a disease state because 
    of minimum information on its transition to pre-clinical colorectal cancer. 
    Hence, detection of adenoma is not tracted in our simulation, and we don't 
    need to model treatment for detected adenoma.
 2. The screening waiting time distirbution is built based on Marketscan data 
    (clinical records for US general population).
 3. The external parameters are not stratified by attributes like age, sex or 
    residence (urban vs rural), unless the literature tells us to do so. We will 
    compare the evidence from China to studies conducted in other locations.
