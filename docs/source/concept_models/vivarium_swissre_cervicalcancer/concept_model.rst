1.0 Background
++++++++++++++

.. _swcc1.1:

1.1 Project overview
--------------------
This project will generate forecasts of cervical cancer mortality and morbidity 
to allow Swiss Re to identify trends that are important to its business 
decision-making. IHME will produce both a baseline (business as usual) forecast, 
and an alternative scenario forecast in which key cervical cancer screening 
practice and HPV vaccination are implemented in a simulation framework. Baseline 
forecasts will incorporate expected trends in relevant risk factors. Alternative 
scenario forecasts will incorporate baseline forecasts and the expected impact of 
new screening technologies and vaccination. All forecasts will represent the Swiss 
Reâ€™s insured population from the weighted blend of Chinese provinces. Forecasts 
run from year 2020 to 2040.

2.0 Modeling aims and objectives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IHME will estimate the yearly number of cases of benign and invasive cervical 
cancer detected under specific cervical cancer screening practices and the yearly 
number of deaths from undetected cervical cancer (both in unit of per 100,000 
insured person-years) in order to identify pay-out trends for cervical cancer 
claims.

4.0 Intervention
++++++++++++++++
There is an urgent need to implement the evidenced-based interventions (e.g. HPV 
vaccination, cervical cancer screening, management of detected disease) for eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem, such action must be 
strategic in nature. [WHO cervical cancer elimination strategy]_

Based on SwissRe's interest, our simulation intervention combined the cervical 
cancer screening and HPV vaccination to evaluate the cervical cancer detection 
in following scenarios:

 - Baseline (status quo scenario): keep HPV vaccination and cervical cancer
   screening coverage constant over time among insured female.
 - Alternative (expected future scenario): scale-up of both cervical cancer 
   screening and HPV vaccination over time among insured female.

.. _swcc4.1:

4.1 Simulation scenarios
------------------------
**Baseline:** by 2040, project existing level of cervical cancer screening for 
insured female aged 21 to 65 years and HPV vaccination for insured female aged 
15 to 45 years.

**Alternative scenario:** by 2030, linear ramp up cervical cancer screening to 
cover 50% of the insured female aged 21 to 65 years and HPV vaccination to cover 
25% of the insured female aged 15 to 45 years. Both of the HPV vaccination and 
cervical cancer screening coverage remain constant in 2030 to 2040.

   * - Alternative
     - HPV vaccination
     - 2030-2040
     - 25%

.. note::

 - Wang et al. reported a current cervical cancer screening coverage of 20.7% 
   with 95%CI 18.6-22.8 in China. We set it as 25% as we believe insured population has higher screening coverage than general population. 
 - No data has identified for current HPV vaccination rates in China. Temporarily 
   we will use 10%.
 - The target HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening coverage in 2030 are 
   guided by IHME and SwissRe's assumption for Chinese insured female.

.. note::
 
 - Co-test (cytology plus HPV test) is not recommended for women under 30 
   according to guidelines from American Cancer Society and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
 - We are not testing HPV for women under 30 and those follow-up with
   cytology alone in one year at Branch B.
 - Women who have been vaccinated or detected BCC and treated should continue 
   to be screened.
 - HPV- specificity value 94.1% is HPV test alone as a proxy for co-test HPV test 
   specificity ( `Reference paper <https://search.proquest.com/openview/73be186c328532400a3e69524aed0bf9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=35707>`_ )

In initialization, We assume that

 - No one has prior knowledge of their disease status (and HPV status) on day one
   of the simulation.
 - All simulants are buying insurance on day one of the simulation.
 - For simulants in cervical cancer (CC) state regardless of detection, they have 
   a transition rate of 0.1 (per person-year) of moving into a recovered (R) state; this results in an average duration in state CC of 10 years. People in state CC and R follow exactly the same screening algorithm, namely branch A, B, or C depending on their age. Simulants do not ever make a second cervical cancer claim, therefore the negative screening results were expected for those in R state in order to avoid double counting the CI claim from detected cervical cancer.

:underline:`II. Screening schedule and attendance`

Probability of attending screening
 - Generate 1000 draws from normal distribution with mean=0.25, SD=0.0025 for
   calculating the probability of simulants attending their first due screening.
 - If simulant attended their last screening, they have a truncated normal 
   distirbution with mean=1.89, SD=0.36, lower=1.0 (Yan et al. 2017) more odds 
   of attending the next screening than those who did not attend their last screening.

:underline:`III. Screening initialization`

The date of the first screening appointment (T_appt) for females at age between 
21 and 65 is determined as follows. We assume that each simulant had a previous 
appointment scheduled at some point before the simulation begins. We calculate 
the time between that past appointment and their next appointment (delta_T) using 
the methodology outlined in Section 5.3.2.II (Time to next scheduled screening). 
With a uniform distribution we randomly determine how far along that time interval 
between appointments each individual is (X) at the beginning of the simulation (
T_0). For females under 21 when the simulation begins the methodology is identical, 
except T_0 is the simulant's 21th birthday rather than the beginning of the 
simulation. No screening appointment will be initialized for females above 65.

:underline:`V. Symptomatic presentation`

In our model, cancer cases are detected through two pathways. (1) individuals 
who get diagnosed from routine screening with a positive test result. (2) 
individuals who didn't go for routine screening but found symptoms then get 
diagnosed. After we add symptomatic presentation module, we will see detected 
cancer cases in cohorts not eligible for routine screening and a smaller 
difference of detection rate between baseline and alternative scenario. We 
assume symptoms will not occur in pre-invasive cervical cancer state, the 
transition rate (lambda) from pre-clinical screening detectable asymptomatic 
invasive cervical cancer (PC) to clinical symptomactic invasive cervical cancer 
is equal to 1 divided by average time spent in PC state (mean sojourn time). In 
cervical cancer development, the mean sojourn time is around **4** years.

:underline:`II. HPV vaccination`

Vaccine coverage
 - Create 1000 draws of HPV vaccination propensity from an uniform distributon 
   U[0, 1] and use constant propensity for every simulation timestep. We assume 
   no one has been vaccinated on day one of the simulation. At each simulation 
   timestep, give the vaccination to unvaccinated women who at 15 to 45 years 
   of age and has a `HPV_vacciation_propensity` value less than the current HPV 
   vaccine coverage level. Use the vaccine coverage specified in section 4.1 
   Simulation scenarios to differentiate coverage threshold between baseline 
   and alternative scenarios.

Vaccine efficacy
 - ZhuÂ et al.Â reported a relative risk of getting HPV 16/18 infection for those 
   unvaccinated versus vaccinated (RR_no_vaccine_hrHPV): use normal distribution 
   **normal(mean=4.71, SD=0.94)**
 - LuÂ et al.Â reported a relative risk of getting BCC without hrHPV infection for 
   those unvaccinated versus vaccinated (RR_no_vaccine_CIN2+): use normal 
   distribution **normal(mean=1.77, SD=0.26)**
 - Use same relative risk (RR_no_vaccine_hrHPV) distribution for people moving
   from `BCC_S_hrHPV to BCC_C_hrHPV` and `ICC_S_hrHPV to ICC_C_hrHPV` among those
   unvaccinated versus vaccinated.
