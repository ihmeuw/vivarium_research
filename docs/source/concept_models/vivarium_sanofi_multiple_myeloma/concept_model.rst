1.0 Background
++++++++++++++
In March of 2020, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a new drug, Isatuximab, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in adults who had previously received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. ([Sanofi-2020]_) A phase 3 clinical study has shown Isatuximab, in addition to pomalidomide-dexamethasone, to significantly improve progression-free survival in patients with RRMM. ([Attal-et-al-2019]_) Since the introduction of Isatuximab on the US drug market, Sanofi has started a clinical registry in the US to observe the use of Isatuximab in patients with RRMM in a real-world setting.  

As Isatuximab is still relatively new and the clinical registry is in early stages of enrollment, Sanofi is interested in using simulation to further understand Isatuximab’s potential impact and aid in registry design. Simulation is a general method that allows the incorporation of inter-related and dynamic factors and processes to predict health outcomes over time. In this project, we employ customized agent-based simulation software in which thousands of simulated individuals (“simulants”) with individual characteristics and health backgrounds experience MM including treatment, progression, and survival in a realistic way. This project is currently planned out in three phases including, 1) simulating the general population in one location and a registry population in the same location, 2) updating input data parameters using real registry data and rerunning the microsimulation from phase 1 iteratively to calibrate with real-world evidence and 3) expanding the microsimulation to other locations of interest. This document will outline the current analysis plan for phase 1 of this project. 

FDA just approved isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd), for the treatment of adult patients with RRMM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy.([Sanofi-2021]_)

Key sub-populations agreed upon include: 

* Black/African American population 

* Population with high-risk cytogenetics 

* Population with renal impairment/CKD (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m^2)

* Elder population (aged > 75 years) 

In the absence of data on treatment effects for sub-groups we will need to make assumptions with client guidance. A strength of this project is that we will be able to iteratively update such assumptions as we get real world data from registries and re-run the simulation.

1.1 Project overview
--------------------
This project intends to model the impact of a new treatment option for myeloma disease, Isatuximab, from 2021 to 2026 among the general population, key subpopulations listed above, and a registry population within the United States. The model will make use of the current multiple myeloma treatment guidelines in the United States, which are dependent on disease status, age, eligibility for stem cell transplantation, risk category, history of malignancy, and duration of previous treatment response.

2.0 Modeling aims and objectives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The primary objective of this project is to answer the following question: what can we expect the incidence, prevalence, and survival of MM to be overall and among a registry population in the United States, under a business-as-usual treatment scenario and an Isatuximab treatment scenario over 5 years, with a focus on key-sub-population of interest? The key sub-populations include the Black/African American population, population with high-risk cytogenetics, population with renal impairment and the elderly population (age > 75 years).  

To answer this question, we will gather data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), SEER, literature, and Flatiron Health and use survival regression to inform the parameters for our simulation. We will simulate the changes in MM and RRMM disease incidence, prevalence and survival from 2021 to 2026 in response to an Isatuximab treatment intervention scenario in the US population and simulated registry population. These outcomes will be stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, renal impairment and cytogenetic risk.

4.0 Intervention
++++++++++++++++

Among MM and RRMM patients, they expect to have:
 - Isatuximab treatment with coverage scale-up from 10% to 45% across 5 years 
   of the simulation. Or
 - Other (non Isa-based) treatment with constant coverage rates across 5 years 
   of the simulation

.. _4.1:

4.1 Simulation scenarios
------------------------

To measure the impact of Isatuximab, we will simulate two scenarios, a baseline 
scenario and an alternative scenario, outlined below. The underlying health state 
of each simulant will be measured at each 28-day time step and the probability 
that each simulant is treated will be dependent on the coverage stated in that 
scenario. 

`We might stratify the treatment covearge rates by simulant’s cytogenetic risk 
level, age, sex, and race/ethnicity if Flatiron data support us to do so.`

**Baseline** The baseline scenario will project GBD 2019 demographic and disease 
trends out from 2021 to 2026. For any simulated population, the coverage rates 
for all regimens except Isatuximab will be held constant across the 5 years of 
the simulation; Isatuximab will start to be available to simulants as a second-line 
regimen and ramp up to 45% coverage by 2026 to simulate a business-as-usual 
treatment scenario.

**Alternative** Most aspects of the alternative scenario will be the same as the 
baseline scenario: it will project GBD 2019 demographic and disease trends out 
from 2021 to 2026 and apply the same coverage rates (or ramp up) for all regimens 
specified in the baseline. In contrast to the baseline scenario, Isatuximab in 
the alternative scenario will start to be available to simulants as a first-line 
regimen among all simulated population.


In the absence of data from Flatiron, we made following assumptions:
 1. The initial treatment coverage of Isatuximab is set to be 10% in 2021.
 2. The probability of simulants treated with Isatuximab is the same across 
    different lines of treatment.
 3. The coverage scale-up of Isatuximab follows the same trend from IQVIA sales 
    projection.

.. note::

 According to IQVIA sales data, the total sales of Isatuximab equal to 
 113 million dollars in 2021. The unit cost for a 12-month Isatuximab treatment 
 is about 145,600 dollars, that yields a total of 776 patients in year 2021 could 
 be treated with Isatuximab. In GBD 2019 summary, there were 89,566 prevalent MM 
 cases in 2019 for all ages and both sexes. As a result, the initial coverage of 
 Isatuximab is calculated to be 1% in 2021, and expect to reach 5% in 2026 based 
 on the slope derived from IQVIA sales projection. (~350% increase from 2021 to 
 2026) So, the endpoint coverage could reach 45% If we set the initial coverage 
 2027) of Isatuximab to be 10% in 2021.

 2. Risk factors (GFR and cytogenetics) 
 3. Causes (progression of multiple myeloma) 
 4. Health system (multiple lines of treatment for MM and RRMM population) 
 5. Patient registry

5.3.1 Disease model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`multiple myeloma cause model<2019_cancer_model_multiple_myeloma>`

.. _5.3.2:

5.3.2 Risk factor model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To study the sub-population of people with CKD and/or high-risk cytogenetics, 
the risk factor model tracks two risk factors: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
and cytogenetic risk. These two risk factors do not directly alter the risk of 
developing MM. Instead, they are considered as determinants in patient and 
disease characteristics. For simulants at a given age, sex, and race/ethnicity, 
the choice of therapy is based on their GFR and cytogenetic risk. 

**GFR** has a continuous risk exposure by age and sex (or race/ethnicity). 
Simulants will be assigned to a CKD stage based on their GFR value. We consider 
4 stages of CKD:
 - No CKD: GFR > 90 ml/min/1.73m^2
 - Mild CKD: GFR 60 to 90 ml/min/1.73m^2
 - Moderate CKD: GFR 30 to 60 ml/min/1.73m^2
 - Severe CKD: GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m^2

**Cytogenetic risk** is a binary risk factor. Simulants will fall into one of 
two risk exposure categories: with high-risk cytogenetics, or with standard-risk 
cytogenetics. We intend to use Flatiron data to inform the existing prevalence 
of high-risk cytogenetics among adults in the US population with multiple myeloma.

.. _5.3.4:

5.3.4 Patient registry model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inlcusion criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This model will track which simulants are included in a registry. To achieve this, 
we need to know who is a registry candidate, and what factors affect the probability 
they will be included in a registry. The registry is running for RRMM patients 
(any newly incident RRMM cases developed from multiple myeloma and the pre-existing 
RRMM cases at the start of the simulation). In general, we will use the criteria 
listed below to decide who is eligible to be enrolled in the registry.
  - 18 years and older
  - With relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM according to IMWG definition)
  - First time using Isa (never received Isa for treatment of disease other than RRMM)
  - No personal history of other malignant cancers in the past 3 years

Besides age and disease status, there are two additional factors we need to 
consider for making a simulant (with RRMM) a registry candidate. First, eligibility 
for Isatuximab treatment, which means this RRMM patient must have had at least 
one previous line of treatment and was never previously treated with Isatuximab 
for diseases other than RRMM.  Second, personal history of malignancy. We will 
exclude any RRMM patients who have been diagnosed and/or treated for another 
malignant neoplasm within three years from the registry.

.. note::
 
 The eligibility of Isatuximab treatment might change based on the guidance from our clients.

Power calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To calculate the number of simulants in the registry for each calendar year from 
2021 to 2026, we will use the equation presented below: 

:math:`N_{enroll}(t) = N_{0} + Prev_{RRMM}(t) \times F_{Isa} \times (1 - F_{other malignancy})`

Where,
 - :math:`N_{enroll}(t)` is the number of simulants in the registry in year t
 - :math:`N_{0}` is the number of simulants in the registry at the beginning of 
   the simulation (e.g., 2021-01-01)
 - :math:`Prev_{RRMM}(t)` is the number of prevalent RRMM cases in year t
 - :math:`F_{Isa}` is the proportion of population eligible for Isatuximab treatment
 - :math:`F_{other malignancy}` is the proportion of population with another 
   malignancy other than RRMM in the past three years

7.0 Limitations
+++++++++++++++

 1. The incorporation of ASCT into the treatment model of the simulation is 
    dependent on data availability. If it is not incorporated we may underestimate 
    the duration to first relapse among MM patients (though because it would not 
    be incorporated in either the baseline or alternative scenarios, we do not 
    expect the proportional difference between the two scenarios would be significantly 
    impacted). To model the effect of ASCT along with the first-line treatment 
    for MM patients, we need additional information on how long patients wait 
    before they can get the transplant. We may overestimate the hazard of not 
    receiving a transplant if we assume any patient who dies before receiving a 
    transplant is a non-transplant patient. We do not intend to incorporate an 
    option for “delayed transplant” in which transplant occurs at first relapse.
 2. We assume the incidence of MM from GBD is the detection rate of symptomatic 
    cases.
 3. Guided by Sanofi’s RRMM patient registry protocol, patients who had previous 
    malignancy in the past 3 years are not eligible to be enrolled in the registry. 
    That means some RRMM patients will be excluded based on their personal history 
    of malignancy. We will use literature evidence or SEER data to inform the 
    proportion of RRMM patients with other malignancy in the past 3 years.
