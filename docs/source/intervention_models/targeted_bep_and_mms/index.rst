Intervention Overview
-----------------------

.. note::

  This intervention has been previously modeled in Vivarium and documentation can be found :ref:`here <2017_concept_model_vivarium_gates_bep>`. 

Maternal supplementataion during the prenatal period is a critical intervention to support the increased nutritional demands due to the mother's changing physiology and fetal growth. Maternal supplementation in low and middle income country settings are often accessed through antenatal care (ANC) services and early initiation of supplementation has been associated with improved outcomes. There are various maternal supplementation regimens that provide varying combinations of micro- and macro-nutrients and therefore have varying impacts on both maternal and child health. Major classes of maternal supplementation regimens are outlined in the table below.

- **Iron and Folic Acid (IFA):** IFA affects outcomes including maternal anemia (which is a risk factor for maternal mortality) and infant birthweight (a risk factor for infant mortality). Additionally, folic acid deficiency is associated with haematological consequences and congenital malformations, however the effect on congenital malformations is sensitive to timing of administration relative to conception. The latest cochrane review of IFA trials was performed by [Pena-Rosas-et-al-2015]_; notably, as IFA is considered the current standard of care, there are few studies that compare IFA to placebo or no treatment.

- **Multiple Micronutrient Supplementation (MMS):** MMS is a combination of micronutrients that includes iron and folic acid as well as other nutrients such as vitamin A and zinc. The latest cochrane review on MMS (containing IFA) relative to IFA alone was performed by [Keats-et-al-2019-maternal-supplementation]_.

- **Balanced Energy Protein (BEP):** BEP is a type of supplement that provides macronutrients in addition to micronutrients provided by IFA and MMS. The macronutrients provided by BEP supplementation may aid in maternal weight gain, which may improve fetal outcomes, and may be particularly beneifcial to underweight pregnant women and their babies. Notably, there are several different formulations of BEP, which may vary in their effectiveness. The latest cochrane review on BEP supplementation was performed by [Ota-et-al-2015]_

In August of 2020, the :download:`World Health Organization updated their recommendation <who_guidance_positive_pregnancy_mms_2020.pdf>` on nutritional interventions during pregnancy to include MMS that includes iron and folic acid as part of routine antenatal care. Prior to this update, they recommended only IFA. Additionally, the :download:`WHO recommends BEP supplementation during pregnancy in undernourished populations <who_guidance_positive_pregnancy_2016.pdf>`.

.. note:: 

  According to the :download:`2016 WHO recommendations <who_guidance_positive_pregnancy_2016.pdf>`: Undernourishment is usually defined by a low BMI (i.e. being underweight). For adults, a 20–39% prevalence of underweight women is considered a high prevalence of underweight and 40% or higher is considered a very high prevalence (46). Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) may also be useful to identify protein–energy malnutrition in individual pregnant women and to determine its prevalence in this population (31). However, the optimal cut-off points may need to be determined for individual countries based on context-specific cost–benefit analyses (31).

IFA is widely used as a prenatal supplement in most areas of the world and is recommended by the WHO as part of routine antenatal care, although coverage and adherence levels vary. Given the relatively recent recommendation regarding MMS and the relatively high cost of BEP, the coverage of these inteventions at a wide scale is believed to be substantially lower.

Baseline Coverage Data
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Given the low utilization of MMS and BEP relative to IFA, we assume that baseline coverage of MMS and BEP are zero. Baseline coverage of IFA varies by location, and Demographic Health Surveys are good data sources for the proportion of pregnant women who took iron supplementation during pregnancy.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

The maternal supplementation intervention is administered to mothers and impacts both the mother and infant. To model the impact of the intervention on either child or maternal outcomes, simulant attributes for maternal nourishment exposure (BMI/x-factor) and maternal ANC attendance exposure are required. Additionally, to model the impact on child growth, child growth exposures are required. To model the impact on maternal mortality, a maternal hemoglobin exposure value is required. This intervention model requires the additional simulant attribute of maternal supplement regimen.

For the implementation of the intervention in an alterative scenarios, we will model BEP supplementation among undernourished mothers and MMS supplementation among adequately nourished mothers rather than IFA supplementation alone, as demonstrated in the following decision tree.

.. note::

  This decision tree assumes a complete transition from IFA to targeted BEP/MMS. Alternative intervention implementations may be considered.

Birthweight
+++++++++++++++++++++

The maternal supplementation intervention (all regimens) affect child birthweight exposures, :ref:`which are documented here <2019_risk_exposure_lbwsg>`. The intervention should result in an **additive change to a simulant's continuous birthweight exposure value at birth (or upon initialization into the early or late neonatal age groups).** We assume there is no corresponding change in a simulant's gestational age exposure value at birth.

    - +66.96g (13.13 to 120.78)
    - Relative to MMN
    - [Ota-et-al-2015]_

.. note::

  Adequately nourished BEP supplemented mothers relative to MMN supplemented mothers birthweight shift is +15.93 grams (-20.83 to 52.69) according to [Ota-et-al-2015]_, but this value should not be used for targeted BEP scenarios given that BEP is only recommneded for undernourished mothers

**How to sample and apply effect sizes:**

The code block below walks through how to implement the following considerations:

- Assume a normal distribution of uncertainty when sampling from the effect size parameter confidence intervals
- Birthweight exposure values need to be calibrated to baseline IFA coverage in the baseline scenario
- Effect sizes in the table above are NOT relative to no supplementation and are assumed to be *additive* to one another. It is important that they are implemented in the method described below due to their overlapping confidence intervals to ensure that the effect of BEP>MMN>IFA in all draws.
- The effect of MMN and BEP in the alternative scenario depends on IFA coverage status in the baseline scenario

  def sample_from_normal_distribution(mean, lower, upper):
      """Instructions on how to sample from a normal distribution given a mean value and
      95% confidence interval for a parameter"""
      std = (upper - lower) / 2 / 1.96

                                                                    {supplement}_upper)
      
      for i in simulants:

      """In the baseline scenario, we need to calibrate baseline coverage of IFA
