This documentation focuses on treatment and management of acute malnutrition in Ethiopia based on 2019 National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition. [EMOH]_

The prevalence of stunting in Ethiopia has declined from 58% in 2000 to 38% in 2016. However, the prevalence of wasting has remained fairly static at 12% in 2000 and 10% in 2016. To address malnutrition in all its forms, the Government is applying two programmatic approaches. The first focuses on increasing access to and availability of food through improved economic growth, better agricultural production systems along with promotion of good nutrition practices and prevention of malnutrition. The second approach aims to strengthen early warning systems and timely emergency response, including wide-scale delivery of services for the management of acute
malnutrition.

The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) developed the first Protocol for the Management of Severe Acute
Malnutrition (SAM) in 2007, and the Guideline for the Management of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)
in 2012. This is the latest National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition in Ethiopia (2019). It includes the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and recommendations, and emerging national and international evidence. It is also aligned to the National Nutrition Programme (NNP) II 2016-2020, the National Food and Nutrition Policy and the Health Sector Transformation Plan (HSTP) 2015/16 - 2019/20.

This flow chart summarizes the core aspects of the care and treatment for SAM and MAM, and integration into the
routine health system.

   Add a general narrative overview of the intervention, including what it is, what outcomes it affects, if/how/when/where it has been used, etc.

.. _waste_tx1.1:

Health system delivery
++++++++++++++++++++++

Interventions for wasting treatment are delivered through different levels of the health system.

:underline:`Community and household level`
 
 Community outreach ensures early identification of SAM and MAM cases. Community outreach also aims to empower communities and families to understand the causes of malnutrition, and prevent and manage acute malnutrition in their communities. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) collaborate with the community-based structures such as health committees and engage with the Health Development Army (HDA)/Health Development Group (HDG) to screen and refer cases to the appropriate service for treatment.

:underline:`Health post level`

 The HPs provide primary health care services such as disease prevention and control, hygiene and environmental sanitation, family health services, and health education and communication. The service provider at the HP works closely with the network of the HDA/HDG to facilitate the management of SAM and MAM. The service provider diagnoses acute malnutrition and provides Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP) services. They also determine patients who have medical complications and refer them to the Stablisation Centre (SC).

:underline:`Health center level`

 The HC provides 24-hour SC for the management of SAM with medical complications. The HC also manages and provides technical support to a cluster of one to five HPs within its vicinity.

:underline:`Hospital level`

 Woreda, Zonal, Regional and referral Hospitals provide higher level referral points where further care can be provided to patients with SAM and more complex medical complications. The referral Hospitals have the facilities and expertise to manage situations that may require administration of oxygen, blood transfusion, and other critical care.

.. _waste_tx2.0:

Assessing and classifying acute malnutrition
--------------------------------------------

The classification and management of SAM and MAM comes from the 2019 National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition. [EMOH]_
which are based on the 2013 WHO guidelines on management of SAM in children and infant [WHO_2013_SAM_guidelines]_

:download:`2019 guidelines<guidelines_2019.pdf>`

.. note:: 
  
    - In GBD, SAM and MAM are classified as using WHZ score. In reality, GBD-MAM kids with oedema are treated as SAM kids. The proportion (sequelae) of GBD-MAM kids with oedema is approximately 2%. In our model these will be classified as MAM. 


Severe acute malnutrition (SAM)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SAM in infants (0-6 months)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`Classify SAM in infants`

* Any grade of bilateral pitting oedema (+, ++ or +++) OR
* WHZ < -3 zscore 

Treatment of infants with SAM in the SC

NOTE: All infants 0-6 months of age with SAM with or without medical complications should be referred to the SC.


SAM in children (>6 months)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since 2007, a new model of care called community-based therapetic care (CTC) or community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) has been endorsed for the treatment of acute malnutrition which addresses the limitations of previous inpatient therapeutic feeding programmes. Patients with severe malnutrition, with good appetite and without medical complications are treated in the outpatient therapeutic programme (OTP) that provides ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and medicines to treat simple conditions. The food and medicines are taken home and patient attends OTP site weekly for monitoring and resupply. 

Severely malnourished persons with medical complications and/or anorexia are treated in an inpatient stabilization center (SC) where they receive standard World Health Organization (WHO)- recommended initial care until they have enough appetite and are well enough to continue with outpatient care. Approximately 10-15% of children in CMAM programmes require inpatient care at the stabilisation centers and the average length-of-stay at an SC is 14 days before they are transferred out to an OTP. [Scott_2020]_ [Tekeste_2012]_ 

:underline:`Classify SAM without medical complications`

* Bilateral pitting oedema + or ++ OR 
* WHZ <-3 z-scores AND 
* Appetite test passed
* No medical complications
* Clinically well and alert

Treatment of children with SAM in OTP

- Admit in OTP (outpatient) programme
- Treatment and care are provided at home with weekly follow-up visits at a nearby health facility. 
- Give routine medications.

:underline:`Classify SAM with medical complications`

* Any grade of bilateral pitting oedema (+, ++, +++) OR 
* WHZ < -3 zscore OR
* Presence of any medical complications (see guideline for full list)

Treatment of children with SAM in SC

- Admit to SC (inpatient)
- Give antibiotics
- Stabilisation phase: F-75 for 7 days
- Transition phase: introduce RUTF gradually with F-75 or F-100 if cannot tolerate RUTF
- Rehabilitation phase: Child transfers from SC to OTP and recieves RUTF in OTP

Discharge criteria

 - Cured = Has reached discharge criteria for SAM treatment: WHZ ≥ -2 z-scores, no bilateral pitting oedema, clinically alert and well. 
 - Died = Dies while receiving treatment in the OTP.
 - Defaulted = Absent for two consecutive visits.
 - Non-responder = Does not reach the SAM discharge criteria after 16 weeks (4 months) in treatment.
 - Transferred out = Condition has deteriorated or not responding to treatment according to action protocol and referred for treatment 
   in the SC, or moved out to receive OTP in another facility


MAM in infants (0-6 months)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

:underline:`Classify MAM in infants`

* MUAC of lactatating mother of infant 0-6 months <23.0 cm
* WHZ ≥-3 to <-2 AND 
* No bilateral pitting oedema AND 
* No medical complications
* Clinically well and alert

Treatment of infants with MAM

Assess the infant’s feeding and counsel the mother or caregiver on appropriate IYCF practices. Emphasize on establishing effective exclusive breastfeeding. If feeding problems, follow up in 5 days. If no feeding problem, follow up in 30 days. Admit the mother to TSFP. Refer the mother for Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP).


MAM in children >6 months
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

:underline:`Classify MAM in children`

* WHZ ≥ -3 to <-2 z scores AND
* No bilateral pitting oedema 
* No medical complications
* Clinically well and alert

Treatment of children with MAM

Admit in TSFP (preferably with RUSF) and counsel on appropriate IYCF practices.


Costs
+++++

A full literature review of costs for CMAM programme is in [Njuguna_2020]_.

1. Cost per child (>6 months) treated for SAM $134.88 2007 USD [Tekeste_2012]_
2. Cost per child (>6 months) treated for MAM using RUSF $38.10 2015 USD [Isanaka_cost_2019]_

For MAM, total costs of MAM treatment were calculated for 5 weeks of follow-up because the mean time to recovery was between 4 and 5 weeks. [Isanaka_cost_2019]_


No acute malnutrition
+++++++++++++++++++++

:underline:`Classify no acute malnutrition in infants`

* WHZ ≥-2 zscores AND 
* No bilateral pitting oedema

**Treatment** 

Congratulate and counsel the mother on appropriate IYCF practices.

.. todo::
    What about MAM with oedema? Are they treated as SAM or MAM?
    Answer: they are treated as MAM in GBD, but in reality, probably SAM. MAM with oedema is approximately 2% of MAM. 

:underline:`Classify no acute malnutritionin children`

* WHZ ≥ -2 z score AND 
* No bilateral pitting oedema

**Treatment**
Congratulate and counsel the mother on appropriate IYCF practices.

    - Direct relationship
  * - Death rate
    - Decreases death rate among the treated
    - No
    - Currently we do not have the relative risk of death of treated/untreated. We will capture some of the effect of tx on death by having the simulants recover faster, therefore leave the high risk wasting states faster. However, by assigning tx simulants the mean death rate when they should have a lower death rate, we are killing more than we should in our sim, hence we might be under-estimating the effect of treatment. (For untreated ppl, we are assigning them the mean death rate when in reality they would have a higher death rate. We under-estimate the harm of not-treating)
  * - Treatment coverage (C)
    - Increases
    - Yes
    - We increase from baseline to 90%.  1-C is uncovered population. (Can do more sensitivity analysis on this)
  * - Efficacy of treatment (E)
    - Increases
    - Yes
    - 'treatment coverage (C)' x 'treatment efficacy (E)' is the 'Effective treatment coverage (CE)'.
  * - Proportion defaulted/unresponsive during programme
    - Decreases
    - Yes
    - As E increases, the porportion not *effectively* covered (C-CE) decreases.


Baseline Coverage Data
++++++++++++++++++++++

The aim and priority in community-based services for the management of acute malnutrition is to reach as many of those affected as possible and to access acutely malnourished children in the *early stages* of their disease. Achieving these goals will maximise impact and the capacity of the service to meet need. Good coverage is a key determinant in **meeting need**. It is important therefore to evaluate coverage, not just  to  assess  the  degree  to  which  need  is  being  met,  but  also  to  understand  what  factors  affect  access and  uptake  of  services,  in  order  to  initiate  action  to  ensure  the  greatest  number  of  people  needing treatment are able to benefit from it. **Coverage can  be  defined  as  the  proportion  of  all  people  needing  or  eligible  to  receive  a  service  who actually  receive  that  service**. [CMAM_Forum_coverage]_

  Treatment coverage = :math:`\frac{\text{Children with MAM/SAM recieving treatment}}{\text{Total number of MAM/SAM kids}}`

Treatment coverage should not be confused with geographical coverage. 

  Geographical coverage (GC) = :math:`\frac{\text{Healthcare facilities/communities delivering MAM/SAM treatments}}{\text{Total number of facilities/communities}}`

Geographic coverage attempts to measure the *availability* of services which does not equate with the *service access* and *uptake*. 

**Effectively covered** is the product of the treatment coverage and the treatment efficacy (proportion of the treated who were cured or 'cure-rate').

  - Effective coverage (EC) = :math:`\text{treatment coverage}\times\text{treatment efficacy}`

  - Not effectively covered = 1 - effective coverage

.. image:: effective_coverage_figure.svg

| SAM programme treatment coverage: 48.8% (37.4-60.4) (this is a point coverage; assumes programmes are not good at case finding) [Isanaka_2021]_
| MAM programme treatment coverage: same as SAM for now until this website is updated https://acutemalnutrition.org/en/countries

    SD = (95%UI upper - 95%UI lower) / 2*1.96


.. note::

  I would like to understand from SWEs what happens when they change age groups, do those on the cusp spontaneously recover? I guess that would make sense...those who survive are stronger than those who died; also prevalence doesn't change that much between 28day-5 years.

where t is the period for which transition the is estimated (a year) eg. 365 days using days as the unit 


.. important::

   For model 2 (wasting exposure only with baseline coverage of treatment but treatment-not-tracked),the above reciprocal of durations were weighted by the baseline treatment coverage of 0.488 (C). Also note that the recovery durations we used for model 2 were slightly different than what we have here in model 4. In model 2, we used:
  
   - r2_ux (sam untreated) = (1-C) x 1/60.5 days 
   - t1_sam = C x 1/48.3 days
   - r3_ux (mam untreated) = (1-C) x 1/63 days
   - t2_mam = C x 1/41.3 days
   - where the rates are in per person-day; multiply by 356 to get per person-year

   Additionally, for the recovery rate from MAM, we used r3 which was = r3_ux(1-C) + t2_mam(C). (See wasting exposure 2020 documentation for the use of these rates).

   Note also that we used the same recovery duration for 0-6 months as 6-59 months in model 2. We have now updated the recovery durations for effectively treated population to be specific for 0-6 months in this model 4.

Deriving :math:`r2_{ux}` for each age and sex specific strata using the baseline treatment coverage (C):

  The incidence correction factor k is = :math:`\frac{t}{\text{average duration of disease}}`
  where t is the period for which incidence is estimated (a year) eg. 365 days using days as the unit 

  k = :math:`\frac{\text{number of incident cases}}{\text{number of prevalent cases}}` see [Isanaka_2021]_ for full proof and equations. 

  Number of incident cases = :math:`\frac{\text{annual programme admissions}}{\text{treatment coverage}}`

  1) From Isanaka 2021, the incidence correction factor for Ethiopia is k = 6.7(95%CI:5.3-8.4) for a baseline population SAM treatment coverage of 48.8(95%CI 37.4 to 60.4)
  2) k = 6.7(95%CI:5.3-8.4) =  :math:`\frac{365}{SAM\_duration (in days)}` 
  3) SAM_duration =  :math:`\frac{365}{6.7}` = 54.5 days
  4) :math:`54.5 = \frac{365}{r2_{ux} \times (1-CE) + t1_{sam} \times (CE) + death\_rate_{age|sex}}` 
  5) Solve for :math:`r2_{ux}` for for each age/sex strata with age/sex specific death rate
 
 where C = 48.8% (95%CI:37.4-60.4), E = 70% (95%CI:64-76)

  For example, if 

  - :math:`death\_rate_{age|sex}` = 0.015 per person year for age group 4 female 
  - :math:`r2_{ux} \times (1 - 0.488  \times 0.7) = \frac{365}{54.5} - (\frac{365}{48.3}  \times 0.488  \times 0.7) - 0.015`
  - :math:`r2_{ux} \times (1 - 0.488  \times 0.7) = 6.697 - 2.581 - 0.015`
  - :math:`r2_{ux} \times (1 - 0.488  \times 0.7) = 4.101`
  - :math:`r2_{ux} =  4.101 / 0.6584 = 6.2287`
  - Duration of untreated SAM = 365 / 6.2287 = 58.6 days for age group 4 female


.. important::

  In this first run that Rajan is building (August-18-21), we are not modelling treatment in the first 28 days of life. If we do model treatment in this first 28 days, the prevalence of wasting by the time they reach post-neonatal age groups in the scale-up scenario will be different (reduced). We should think through the relationship between wasting and LBWSG in the neonatal age groups and see if we want to add treatment back into the first month of life.

  How the value r2_ux was derived for model 2: 

  1) From Isanaka 2021, the incidence correction factor K = 6.7 for a population SAM coverage of 48.8% 
  2) K = 1 year/duration of SAM (in years) = 6.7
  3) Duration of SAM in years = 1/6.7 = 0.149253 years = 54.5 days
  4) 365/(r2_ux + t1_sam + d1) = 54.5 
  5) 365/(r2_ux + [0.488 x 365/48.3] + [yearly rate of death]) = 54.5; using d1 = 0.015 for age_group 4 and sex 2
  6) r2_ux = 2.9945
  7) r2_ux = (1-Csam) X 365/Dsam_utx (1-Csam = 0.512)
  8) Dsam_utx ~ 62 days (will need to recalculate by age and sex)

  Note that 

  r2_ux = untreated% x 365/Dsam_utx
  t1_sam = treated% x 365/Dsam_tx

  Also note that Dsam_tx < Dsam_utx (time to recovery of tx SAM is shorter than time to recovery of untreated SAM)
  
  *We did not calculate a specific r2_ux value for each age and sex in model 2*

  Hence when we ramp up coverage (treated% increases), t1_sam also increases. Duration of SAM will decrease. Without changing incidence, our prevalence of SAM should also decrease (P = incidence x Duration). Our intervention could also work by decreasing the time to recovery, in which case t1_sam increases and prevalence will decrease (without changing incidence).


Affected Outcomes
+++++++++++++++++

Scaling up the effective coverage of SAM and MAM, we will increase treatment coverage and also efficacy of the treatment programme to increase effective coverage (EC).

  Describe exactly *how* to apply the effect sizes to the affected measures documented above

  Note research considerations related to generalizability of the effect sizes listed above as well as the strength of the causal criteria, as discussed on the :ref:`general research consideration document <general_research>`.

Assumptions and Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We are not applying a differential death rate to those effectively covered vs not effectively covered
- We are generalizing across the whole country. There is likely to be a lot of heterogeneity within the country. 
- We do not have the durations of untreated SAM and MAM for 0-6 age groups hence we are using the durations from 6-59 age groups.
