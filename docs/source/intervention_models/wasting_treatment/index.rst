This documentation focuses on treatment and management of acute malnutrition in Ethiopia based on 2019 National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition. [EMOH]_

The prevalence of stunting in Ethiopia has declined from 58% in 2000 to 38% in 2016. However, the prevalence of wasting has remained fairly static at 12% in 2000 and 10% in 2016. To address malnutrition in all its forms, the Government is applying two programmatic approaches. The first focuses on increasing access to and availability of food through improved economic growth, better agricultural production systems along with promotion of good nutrition practices and prevention of malnutrition. The second approach aims to strengthen early warning systems and timely emergency response, including wide-scale delivery of services for the management of acute
malnutrition.

The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) developed the first Protocol for the Management of Severe Acute
Malnutrition (SAM) in 2007, and the Guideline for the Management of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)
in 2012. This is the latest National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition in Ethiopia (2019). It includes the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and recommendations, and emerging national and international evidence. It is also aligned to the National Nutrition Programme (NNP) II 2016-2020, the National Food and Nutrition Policy and the Health Sector Transformation Plan (HSTP) 2015/16 - 2019/20.

Intervention Overview
---------------------

This flow chart summarizes the core aspects of the care and treatment for SAM and MAM, and integration into the
routine health system. 

.. image:: flow_chart_management_of_acute_malnutrition.svg
   :alt: Flow chart of management of acute malnutrition

.. todo::

   Add a general narrative overview of the intervention, including what it is, what outcomes it affects, if/how/when/where it has been used, etc.

.. _1.1:

Health system delivery
++++++++++++++++++++++

Interventions for wasting treatment are delivered through different levels of the health system.

:underline:`Community and household level`
 
 Community outreach ensures early identification of SAM and MAM cases. Community outreach also aims to empower communities and families to understand the causes of malnutrition, and prevent and manage acute malnutrition in their communities. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) collaborate with the community-based structures such as health committees and engage with the Health Development Army (HDA)/Health Development Group (HDG) to screen and refer cases to the appropriate service for treatment.

:underline:`Health post level`

 The HPs provide primary health care services such as disease prevention and control, hygiene and environmental sanitation, family health services, and health education and communication. The service provider at the HP works closely with the network of the HDA/HDG to facilitate the management of SAM and MAM. The
 service provider diagnoses acute malnutrition and provides Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP) services. They also determine patients who have medical complications and refer them to the Stablisation Centre (SC).

:underline:`Health center level`

 The HC provides 24-hour SC for the management of SAM with medical complications. The HC also manages and provides technical support to a cluster of one to five HPs within its vicinity.

:underline:`Hospital level`

 Woreda, Zonal, Regional and referral Hospitals provide higher level referral points where further care can be provided to patients with SAM and more complex medical complications. The referral Hospitals have the facilities and expertise to manage situations that may require administration of oxygen, blood transfusion, and other critical care.

.. _2.0:

Assessing and classifying acute malnutrition
--------------------------------------------

The classification and management of SAM and MAM comes from the 2019 National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition. [EMOH]_
which are based on the 2013 WHO guidelines on management of SAM in children and infant [WHO_2013_SAM_guidelines]_

:download:`2019 guidelines<guidelines_2019.pdf>`


.. note:: 
  
    - In GBD, SAM and MAM are classified as using WHZ score. In reality, GBD-MAM kids with oedema are treated as SAM kids. We need to check the proportion (sequelae) of GBD-MAM kids to see if we need to make this adjustment in our model.    

.. _2.1:

In infants 0-6 months
+++++++++++++++++++++

:underline:`Classify SAM in infants`

* Any grade of bilateral pitting oedema (+, ++ or +++) OR
* WHZ < -3 zscore 

**Treatment**

NOTE: All infants 0-6 months of age with SAM with or without medical complications should be referred to the SC.

:underline:`Classify MAM in infants`

* MUAC of lactatating mother of infant 0-6 months <23.0 cm
* WHZ ≥-3 to <-2 AND 
  * No bilateral pitting oedema AND 
  * No medical complications
  * Clinically well and alert

**Treatment** 

Assess the infant’s feeding and counsel the mother or caregiver on appropriate IYCF practices. Emphasize on establishing effective exclusive
breastfeeding. If feeding problems, follow up in 5 days. If no feeding problem, follow up in 30 days. Admit the mother to TSFP. Refer the mother for Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP).

:underline:`Classify no acute malnutrition in infants`

* WHZ ≥-2 zscores AND 
* No bilateral pitting oedema

**Treatment** 

Congratulate and counsel the mother on appropriate IYCF practices.

.. _2.1:

In children 6-59 months
++++++++++++++++++++++++

:underline:`Classify SAM with medical complications`

* Any grade of bilateral pitting oedema (+, ++, +++) OR 
* WHZ < -3 zscore OR
* Presence of any medical complications (see guideline for full list)

**Treatment**

Admit to SC (inpatient)

:underline:`Classify SAM without medical complications`

* Bilateral pitting oedema + or ++ OR 
* WHZ <-3 z-scores AND 
  * Appetite test passed
  * No medical complications
  * Clinically well and alert

**Treatment**

Admit in OTP (outpatient)

:underline:`Classify MAM`

* WHZ ≥ -3 to <-2 z scores AND
  * No bilateral pitting oedema 
  * No medical complications
  * Clinically well and alert

**Treatment**

Admit in TSFP (preferably with RUSF) and counsel on appropriate IYCF practices.

:underline:`Classify no acute malnutrition`

* WHZ ≥ -2 z score AND 
* No bilateral pitting oedema

**Treatment**

Congratulate and counsel the mother on appropriate IYCF practices.

  Fill out the following table with a list of known outcomes affected by the intervention, regardless of if they will be included in the simulation model or not, as it is important to recognize potential unmodeled effects of the intervention and note them as limitations as applicable.

  The table below provides example entries for large scale food fortification with iron.

.. list-table:: Affected Outcomes
  :widths: 15 15 15 30
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Outcome
    - Effect
    - Modeled?
    - Note (ex: is this relationship direct or mediated?)
  * - Median time-to-recovery
    - Decreases 
    - Yes
    - Direct relationship
  * - Death rate
    - Decreases death rate among the treated
    - No
    - Currently we do not have the relative risk of death of treated/untreated. We will capture some of the effect of tx on death by having the simulants recover faster, therefore leave the high risk state faster. However, by assigning utx simulants the mean death rate when they should have a higher death rate, we might overestimate the protective effect of tx on death.
  * - Proportion recovered within programme treatment length
    - Increases
    - No (but we can)
    - We assume that all treatment covered will recover within the time-to-recovery if they had not died. We can modify the treatment coverage by multiplying it by the 'cure rate' giving us the 'met-need' instead. 1 - 'met-need' will be the 'utx' population. 
  * - Proportion defaulted during programme
    - Decreases
    - We can capture this by using 'met-need'
    - This will decrease as 'met-need' increases.


Baseline Coverage Data
++++++++++++++++++++++++

| SAM programme coverage: 48.8% (37.4 - 60.4) (point coverage, assumes programmes are not good at case finding) [Isanaka_2021]_
