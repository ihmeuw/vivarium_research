Outreach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under this scenario, the effectiveness of the delivery of SBP-lowering and LDL-c lowering therapies would increase through methods such as a phone call, app, or support clinic. 

**Source information:**

Black patients, when prescribed statin as a new medication within the past 1 year, receive automated phone calls and letters starting 1-2 weeks after prescribing, which encourages them to fill the prescription (primary adherence). Receiving this intervention increases fill and initiation of statin from 26% to 42% of patients. OR for intervention vs control was 2.16 (1.91-2.43). Effectively, patients were twice as likely to initiate medication during the first 30 days if intervention was delivered.  
[Derose-2013]_

Patients, age 30-60 without IHD, but who met any of the following criteria: current tobacco smoker, LDL-c > 3.37 mmol/L, or SBP >140 mmHg, received access to a non-clinical community health center with nurse-practitioner counseling on diet, tobacco use, and exercise. Telephone follow-up and free YMCA exercise sessions were offered. The comparison group received standard of care. Both groups had medication copays covered. At 1 year, statin adherence had a relative odds of 2.2 (95% CI 1.11-4.2) and blood pressure medication adherence had a relative odds of 2.3 (95% CI 1.39-3.88) compared to the control group. 
[Becker-2005]_

**Implementation:**

For the first 30 days, new statin and blood pressure prescription adherence is increased according to Derose 2013. Adherence to the medications over 1 year after initiation should be increased according to Becker 2005. Effect can persist beyond the length of study.  

**Scenarios:**
	- Outreach 1.0: Following a prescription of new statin or blood pressure-lowering medication, the initial medication fill rate is increased by 2x and the medication adherence each month is increased 2x.  
	- Outreach 0.5: Outreach at 50% efficacy and coverage (1.5x increase in the initial medication fill rate for a random 50% of simulants receiving new prescribed medication, 1.5x increase in the medication adherence for the same 50% of simulants on medications) 


Polypill
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This scenario involves fixed dose combination medication (blood pressure lowering and lipid lowering), which lead to an expected reduction in SPB and LDL-c.  

**Source information:**

Individuals with prevalent IHD, past ischemic stroke, prevalent PAD, or 5-year CVD risk of 15% or greater received a free 6-month-at-a-time supply of a polypill of either version 1 (aspirin, 75 mg; simvastatin, 40 mg; lisinopril, 10 mg; and atenolol, 50 mg) or version 2 (aspirin, 75 mg; simvastatin, 40 mg; lisinopril, 10 mg; and hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg). Compared with usual care, at 12 months, the polypill group was more likely to be adherent with medications (adjRR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.18). 
[Thom-2013]_ 

**Implementation:**

Adherence to blood pressure lowering and statin medications over 1 year after initiation should be increased according to the above study, though in this scenario we will actually deliver the following combination: atorvastatin (10 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), losartan (25 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg). Effect can persist beyond the length of the study.  
[Munoz-NEJM]_ 

**Scenarios:**
	- Polypill 1.0: All individuals with IHD, past ischemic stroke, or prevalent PAD (who are not already on medications) receive atorvastatin (10 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), losartan (25 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) regardless of SBP or LDL-c levels. Medications lead to expected reduction in SBP and LDL-c. Adherence is increased 13% following receipt of those medications.  
	- Polypill 0.5: Above scenario with, but a reduction to 50% of individuals meeting criteria receiving prescription for atorvastatin (10 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), losartan (25 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) regardless of SBP or LDL-c levels). Medications lead to expected reduction in SBP and LDL-c. Adherence among individuals receiving therapy is increased 13% following receipt of those medications. 


4.1.3 Lifestyle modification education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under this scenario, lifestyle modification education regarding physical activity, healthy eating, weight loss, and tobacco cessation is utilized.  

**Source information:**

Individuals were enrolled in the diabetes prevention program if their BMI was >= 25, they had no known DM2, and their FPG was 100-125mg/dl (or HgbA1C 5.7-6.4). They attended a median of 14 community-based sessions over a median of 134 days. Sessions included lifestyle and behavior counselling with a focus on increasing moderate physical activity, healthy eating, and weight loss. Each additional session attended led to 0.31% loss of body weight.  
[Ely-2017]_  

Variations on the above intervention increased support time or added meal replacements for the first month or full year  
[Metz-et-al-2000]_ 

**Scenarios:**
	- Lifestyle 1.0: Enrollment will occur following a routine health facility or primary care visit. Individuals with BMI >= 25 or FPG 100-125 mg/dl at the time of the visit will receive weekly sessions for 6 months followed by monthly sessions for 6 months. Each session attended will result in 0.3% loss of body weight (initially represented as BMI, but eventually to use weight when available). Adherence will decline in a linear fashion, with 50% of individuals continuing sessions at 6 months and all completing sessions by 1 year.  
	- Lifestyle 0.5: Scenario described above but with 50% of adherence at initiation; adherence will decline in a linear fashion from that point. 


4.1.4 Combined scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Combination 1.0: Combination of outreach 1.0, polypill 1.0, and lifestyle 1.0  
	- Combination 0.5: Combination of outreach 0.5, polypill 0.5, and lifestyle 0.5
