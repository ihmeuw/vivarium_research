Initialization
**********************

This section provides additional details about hypertension and hypercholesterolemia treatment and how medications are changed and/or increased over time. For blood pressure, this is also referred to as the "SBP ramp".

Baseline Coverage Data
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Baseline coverage of treatment for elevated SBP and elis substantial and expected to vary by age, sex, and time. Bask To initialize simulants, the research team has fit a multinomial regression to NHANES data. 

 :math:`\ln(\frac{P(tx=SBPonly)}{P(tx=none)}) = b_{10} + b_{11}(SBP_{level}) + b_{12}(LDL_{level}) + b_{13}age_{(yrs)} + b_{14}sex`
 :math:`\ln(\frac{P(tx=LDLonly)}{P(tx=none)}) = b_{20} + b_{21}(SBP_{level}) + b_{22}(LDL_{level}) + b_{23}age_{(yrs)} + b_{24}sex`
 :math:`\ln(\frac{P(tx=Both)}{P(tx=none)}) = b_{30} + b_{31}(SBP_{level}) + b_{32}(LDL_{level}) + b_{33}age_{(yrs)} + b_{34}sex`

[[Should this also predict which simulants are non-adherent to treatment?]] 

This initialization scheme will also allow initialization of "untreated LDL-C" and "untreated SBP" attributes, which refer to what a simulants risk exposure would be, if they were not receiving treatment.   Individuals who are initialized to be receive treatment will also need to be initialized to have a follow-up visit date somehow.

Baseline coverage of polypill, medication outreach, and lifestyle modification education are all low, and we will assume that they are 0%. (This means that we will can initialize the untreated BMI, FPG, and smoking risk exposures to be equal to the actual BMI, FPG, and smoking exposures.)

Weighted means of treatment (not specific to drug class) by age, sex, and SBP category (in 10 mm Hg groups) are here: /share/scratch/projects/cvd_gbd/cvd_re/simulation_science/nhanes_sbp_tx_info.csv

Medication initiation:
All simulants enrolled in the intervention initiate treatment (defined as initial fill of prescription(s))

Adherence:
All simulants get number from 0 to 1 drawn from non-uniform distribution of adherence in the general population [need to find]. Simulants with values >=0.8 are considered adherent and receive the full benefit of their medication.

ASCVD Risk score
score = -19.5 + 0.043 * sbp + 0.266 * age + 2.32 * sex

On each time step, follow this a decision tree to adjust the treatment for a simulant: (a) does simulant interact with health system? Answer depends on outpatient visit rate, emergency visit if simulant had a heart attack, follow-up visit scheduled time and adherence rate.
If (a) is yes, if visit is for an emergency, (b) does provider overcome therapeutic inertia?
If (b) is yes, increase treatment for SBP and/or LDL-C
If (b) is no, (c) does measured SBP and/or measured LDL-C exceed threshold for increased treatment?
If (c) is yes, (d) does provider overcome therapeutic inertia?
If (d) is yes, increase treatment for SBP and/or LDL-C
If treatment was increased for SBP and/or LDL-C, (e) does patient initiate new prescription?
If patient has initiated a prescription (on this timestep or previously), (f) does patient adhere to treatment?
[[to add: schedule follow-up visit, give polypill instead of separate pills, refer to lifestyle medication education, enroll in medical outreach. Also make sure to document data sources for all parameters, e.g. probability simulant has outpatient visit to help answer (a) in simulation.]]
