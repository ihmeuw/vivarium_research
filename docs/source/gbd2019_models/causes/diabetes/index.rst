Disease Overview
----------------

Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells. 

There are several types of diabetes, each with distinct characteristics. In type 1 diabetes, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin have been destroyed by the immune system. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin injections to survive. In type 2 diabetes, either the pancreas produces sufficient insulin, but cells are not able to properly use it to metabolize glucose or insulin production is insufficient. Depending on the severity of the disease, type 2 diabetes can be treated by oral medications, or individuals may require treatment with insulin. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes. While it can develop at any age, it is most common in middle-aged and older people.  

A third type is gestational diabetes, which develops in some women during pregnancy. Usually, gestational diabetes resolves after birth. Gestational diabetes increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.

State and Transition Data Tables
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section gives necessary information to software engineers for building the model. 
This section usually contains four tables: Definitions, State Data, Transition Data and Data Sources.

Definitions
"""""""""""

This table contains the definitions of all the states in **cause model diagram**. 

.. list-table:: State Definitions
   :widths: 5 5 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - State Name
     - Definition
   * - 
     - 
     - 
   * - 
     - 
     - 

For example, the *Definitions* table for *SIR* and *With-Condition and Free of Condition Model* models are as below:

**SIR Model**

.. list-table:: State Definitions
   :widths: 5 5 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State

     - Definition
   * - S

     - Susceptible to {cause name}
   * - I
     - Infected
     - Infected with {cause name}
   * - R
     - Recovered
     - Infected with {cause name}


**With-Condition and Free of Condition Model**

.. list-table:: State Definitions
   :widths: 1, 5, 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - State Name

   * - C
     - With **C**\ ondition
     - Born with {cause name}
   * - F
     - **F**\ ree of Condition
     - Born without {cause name}

Include states, their names and definitions appropriate to your model.

States Data
"""""""""""

This table contains the **measures** and their **values** for each state in cause-model diagram. This information is used to 
initialize the model. The common measures in each state are prevalence, birth prevalence, excess mortality rate and disability weights. 
Cause specific mortality rate is the common measure for all states. In most of the models either prevalence or birth prevalence is used. 
But in some rare cases like neonatal models both prevalence and birth prevalence are used in model initialization. The Value column contains the formula to calculate 
the measure in each state.

The structure of the table is as below. For each state, the measures and values must be included.

.. list-table:: States Data
   :widths: 20 25 30 30

   * - ALL
     - cause specific mortality rate
     - :math:`\frac{\text{deaths_cid}}{\text{population}}`
     - 

Transition Data
"""""""""""""""

This table contains the measures needed for transition from one state to other in the cause model. The common measures used are *incident rate* to 
move from Susceptible to Infected and *remission rate* to move from Infected to Susceptible or Recovered states. Some times there may not be transition 
between states as in Neonatal disorders.

The structure of the table is as below. 

.. list-table:: Transition Data
   :widths: 10 10 10 20 30
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Transition

     - 
   * - r

An example, if the data is present in GBD,

.. list-table:: Transition Data
   :widths: 10 10 10 20 30
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Transition

     - 
   * - r
     - I
     - R
     - remission_rate_cid
     - 

Sometimes, we might need to use *modelable entity id* to get data. Sometimes, we might need to calculate remission rate 
based on average case duration. In that case, the row would look like,

.. list-table:: Transition Data
   :widths: 10 10 10 20 30
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Transition
     - Source

     - I
     - R
     - remission_rate_cid :math:`= \frac{\text{365 person-days}}{\text{average case duration in days} \times \text{1 year}}`
     - 
	 

Data Sources
