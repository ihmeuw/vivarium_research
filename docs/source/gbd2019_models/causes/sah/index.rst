Disease Overview
----------------

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. There are two main causes of stroke: a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage (combination is referred to as hemorrhagic stroke)). Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. This is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA); symptoms of a TIA last less than 24 hours. While there are no long term-effects of TIAs, they have been shown to increase the risk of subsequent strokes. 

Subarachnoid hemorrhage is the occurrence of bleeding into the space between the surface of the brain, or pia mater, and the arachnoid, one of three coverings of the brain.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

GBD 2019 Non-Fatal Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Stroke was defined according to WHO criteria - rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (at times global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin. Data on transient ischemic attack (TIA) were not included. [WHO-Stroke-Definition-SAH]_. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is defined by GBD as bleeding into the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater of the brain or spinal cord) that is not caused by trauma. We model first ever strokes as acute events; recurrent strokes are captured in the chronic phase of the modeling process. 

For subarachnoid hemorrhage, data using alternate definitions of incidence and excess mortality were adjusted relative to the reference case definition using MR-BRT. The reference case definition for subarachnoid hemorrhage is first ever, subtype-specific data which also includes subjects who did not survive to hospital admission. We incorporate data from scientific literature, registries, and administrative inpatient records in our analysis.

See below for the details on the severity levels for acute and chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage in GBD and the associated disability weight (DW) with that severity. These values are valid only for results from GBD 2019 and GBD 2017.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

This cause model is designed to simulate the occurrence of first and recurrent acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is not designed to simulate recurrent events where the second event is a different type of stroke. When incorporating risk factors, BMI, SBP, LDL cholesterol, smoking, FPG, physical inactivity, and total alcohol consumption should affect transition rates 1 and 3 through the GBD measure of incidence for each stroke cause. 

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Stroke cases are considered acute from the day of incidence of a first-ever stroke through day 28 following the event. The GBD category of chronic stroke includes the sequelae of an acute stroke AND all recurrent stroke events. Stroke cases are considered chronic beginning 28 days following the occurrence of an event. The incidence rate of first ever strokes and recurrent strokes are considered to be the same.
