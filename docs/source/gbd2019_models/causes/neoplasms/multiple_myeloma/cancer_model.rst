Disease Overview
----------------

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell neoplasm with substantial morbidity and mortality, characterized by end organ damage—renal 
impairment, hypercalcemia, lytic bony lesions, and anemia. 

According to GBD 2019, there were 27 thousand incident cases (95%UI 23-33), 18 thousand deaths (95%UI 16-21), and 350 thousand (95%UI 326–431) disability adjusted life years (DALYs) due to multiple myeloma in the US in 2019.

From 2010 to 2019, MM incident cases increased by 25%, and deaths increased by 27% for both sexes in the US.

With the development of better therapies, myeloma has changed from an untreatable ailment to one that is still not curable but treatable with mostly outpatient therapy. 
Although several new treatment options for multiple myeloma are now available, there is no cure for this disease. And almost all patient with multiple myeloma develop relapse/refractory.
Relapse is an inevitable feature of multiple myeloma, resulting in a continued need for new active treatments. Relapse is the return of a cancer, multiple myeloma here, after a clinically disease-free interval. The term relapse is usually used to describe the return of a leukemia, lymphoma, or other hematopoietic malignancy, rather than the return of a carcinoma, according to National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program [SEER]_. 

Refractory multiple myeloma is multiple myeloma that is not responsive to usual therapies. Patients are considered to have relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma if they have achieved a minor response or better to treatment relapse and then progress on salvage therapy, or experience progression within 60 days of their last therapy.

The combination of pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone is an approved and established option for the treatment of relapsed and refractory myeloma in
patients who have received at least two previous therapies. A randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 study [Attal-et-al-2019-mm]_
was taken to compare isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Result shows that the addition of isatuximab to pomalidomide and dexamethasone was associated with a significant and
clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival in heavily treated patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma with results from both the investigators
and an independent response committee being consistent.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy

Multiple Myeloma in GBD 2019
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In GBD 2019, MM includes death and disability resulting from malignant neoplasms of plasma cells, including ICD-10 codes such as C90.0. The GBD modelling strategy can be found in the GBD YLD Capstone Appendix [GBD-2019-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1-Neoplasms]_. 

There is nothing custom about how MM is modeled in GBD compared to the other cancer causes that go through our standard fatal and non-fatal modeling pipelines.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

To study the impact of different lines of treament for myeloma patients, we 
split multiple myeloma into two disease states: active multiple myeloma (MM); 
and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The RRMM state consists of 
multiple relpase stages. Each relapse stage is subsequent outcome corresponding 
to each line of treatment. This MM cause model is intended to simulate MM incidence, 
RRMM incidence, RRMM progression, as well as the mortality from MM and RRMM. The 
inputs for this cause model come from GBD 2019 estimates, scientific literature, 
and survival regression analysis supported by Flatiron data.

Notably, the survival regression anlaysis supported by Flatiron data provides 
data on the time to death *from any cause* among multiple myeloma patients and 
does not present data on the time to death due to multiple myeloma, specifically.
Therefore, the excess mortality defined in this document will be the only source 
of mortality among simulants with multiple myeloma and excess mortality among
simulants with multiple myeloma for "other causes," as typically defined by the 
cause-deleted all-cause mortality rate, should be zero.

Model Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. This cause model assumes no recovery from MM and RRMM since myeloma is an 
   incurable disease. Patients with MM will inevitably develop relapse and the 
   health outcomes worsen with every relapse and line of treatment.
2. This cause model assumes that the GBD incidence rate corresponding to the incidence 
   of symptomatic MM. That's said, we are comfortable using GBD incidence of MM 
   as the detection rate of symptomatic MM cases. The incidence of RRMM will be 
   calculated from survival regression analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model.
3. The asymptomatic/idolent state (smoldering MM) is excluded from this cause 
   model because we are not interested in the screening and early managment for 
   MM. As a result, the simulation will not track/model simulants with asymptomatic 
   condition.
4. YLLs are substantially larger than YLDs for this cause. For now, we will not 
   build a disability component to capture those secondary outcomes.
5. Based on available data, the most advanced disease state in cause model is 
   fourth or higher relapse of RRMM. We intended to track deaths from simulants 
   who have developed fourth relapse and received fifth-line of treatment but ignore 
   the incident cases from fourth relapse to higher relapse of RRMM. As a result, 
   we will not calculate progress-free survival among simulants with fourth or 
   higher relapse of RRMM.

Multiple Myeloma Mortality Details
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As previously mentioned, the excess mortality rates defined in the tables above
represent *all-cause* mortality rates among patients 
with multiple myeloma. For simplicity, in our simulation, deaths that occur among 
simulants in any of the multiple myeloma cause model states other than susceptible
should be recorded as deaths due to multiple myeloma. While deaths due to other
causes are typically modeled in Vivarium cause models among simulants with a given
cause, simulants in multiple myeloma cause model states other than the susceptible 
state should have zero probability of death due to other causes. Simulants without
multiple myeloma (in the susceptible cause model state) should die due to causes
other than multiple myeloma ("other causes") at a rate equal to the multiple
myeloma-deleted all cause mortality rate. Details are shown in the table below.

.. list-table:: MM State-Specitfic Mortality Hazard Rates and Causes of Death
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Cause model state

   * - All MM states
     - state-specific EMR from state table data

Notably, the multiple myeloma mortality rate used to model excess mortality among simulants with multiple myeloma is informed by Flatiron data and the multiple myeloma mortality rate to inform the multiple myeloma-deleted all cause mortality rate among simulants without multiple myeloma is informed by GBD. Mortality rates informed by Flatiron and GBD should be similar in order to accurately model all-cause mortality rates in our simulation; this should be evaluated in model verification and validation.

Estimate MM Prevalence by Disease Stage
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Burn-in method: current proposal is to assume the prevalence of MM from GBD 
estimates evenly distributed across different stages of this disease. We let 
simulation starts from 10 years prior to 2021-01-01 in order to correct the 
distirbution of prevalence of MM by disease stage in 2021. Mathematically, the 
distribution of MM prevalence in 2021 will be like :math:`m \times P^{n}`. Where 
m is initial distribution of MM prevalence, P is transition probability matrix, 
and n is burn-in period. To exam the estimated prevalence of MM and RRMM, we will 
compare prevalence ratio of MM to RRMM (sum over prevalence of all MM relapse 
stages) against ratio from SEER data in US. At the end, we expect that prev_MM > 
prev_MM_first_relapse > prev_MM_second_relapse > ... > 
prev_MM_fourth_or_higher_relapse in 2021.

Survival Regression Model
-------------------------

Model Overview
++++++++++++++

The rates for RRMM are unknown from GBD. So we plan to use the `time-varying Cox's 
proportional hazard model` to predict the transition from MM to RRMM, the transition 
between relapses within RRMM, the mortality from MM, and the mortality from RRMM 
(every relapse). These rates are assumed to be dependent on covariates such as 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, renal function, cytogenetic risk, and different lines 
of therapy. Our survival regression aims to model the rates as a function of hazard 
that is determined by time and a series of covariates. Moreover, time-varying 
regression model will allow us to model individuals' covariate (e.g., age) that 
changes over time. The idea behind this model is that the log-hazard of an individual 
is a linear function of their covariates and a population-level baseline that 
changes over time. Mathematically: 

:math:`h(t|x) = b_{0}(t) \times \exp\left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^n \beta_{i}(x_{i}(t)-\bar{x_{i}})\right)`

Where,
 - :math:`t` is the survival time
 - :math:`x` is the covariate
 - :math:`h(t|x)` is the hazard function determined by a set of covariates
 - :math:`b_{0}(t)` is the baseline hazard
 - :math:`\beta_{i}` is the coefficient that measures the impact of covariate
 - :math:`\sum \limits_{i=1}^n \beta_{i}(x_{i}(t)-\bar{x_{i}})` is the time-variant log partial hazard

This survival model consists of two parts: the underlying baseline hazard function, 
often denoted as :math:`b_{0}(t)`, describing how the risk of event per time unit 
changes over time at baseline levels of covariates; and the effect parameters, 
describing how the hazard varies in response to explanatory covariates. The baseline 
hazard function is consistent across time, calculated from the start when all 
covariates are set to zero. It could be parametric or non-parametric depending 
on what data are available in Flatiron. We hope that the coefficient of effect 
for all relevant covariates can be guided by Flatiron data as well.

From the survival regression model, we expect to output the survival/hazard as a 
function of time to tell when an event will happen and its likelihood, in a 
baseline survival model and a model with different values of covariates. In general, 
We will create two survival regression models:

 1. Mortality hazard model to predict time to death from MM and time to death from
    each of relapse states. 
 2. Transition hazard model to predict time from MM to RRMM, and time between last 
    relapse and next relapse within RRMM state. 

Model Assumptions
+++++++++++++++++

 - The proportional hazard model assumes that `all` individuals have the same hazard 
   function, but a unique scaling factor infront. So the `shape` of the hazard function 
   is the same for all individuals, and only a scalar multiple changes per individual.
 - Another key assumption is that each covariate has a multiplicative effect in 
   the hazard function that is constant over time.

Diagnostics for the Cox Model
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 - Testing the proportional hazards assumption (Schoenfeld residual)
 - Detecting nonlinearity for continous variables (Martingale residual)
 - Examining influential observations (Deviance residual)

We will perform certain diagnostic tests for the Cox’s proportional hazard model. 
To check the model assumptions, residual methods are intended to be used in our 
survival analysis. In principle, the Schoenfeld residuals are independent of time. 
A plot that shows a non-random pattern against time is evidence of a violation of 
the PH assumption. By plotting event time against the Schoenfeld residual for each 
covariate, we except to see a non-significant relationship between Schoenfeld 
residuals and time. Often, we assume that continuous covariates have a linear form. 
However, this assumption should be checked. We can detect the nonlinearity between 
log hazard and the covariates by plotting the Martingale residual against continuous 
covariates. In addition, we plan to use the Deviance residual (a normalized 
transform of the martingale residual) to examine any influential observations 
or outliers.

To check the performance of Cox's model, we will include goodness of fit in our 
survival analysis results. Specifically, Cox-Snell residuals will be used to assess 
a model's goodness-of-fit. By plotting the Cox-Snell residual against the cumulative 
hazard function a model's fit can be assessed. We might modify the standard Cox-Snell 
residuals to account for the censored observations.
