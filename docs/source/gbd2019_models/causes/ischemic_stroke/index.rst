Ischemic Stroke
===============

Disease Overview
----------------

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. There are two main causes of stroke: a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage (combination is referred to as hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. This is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA); symptoms of a TIA last less than 24 hours. While there are no long term-effects of TIAs, they have been shown to increase the risk of subsequent strokes. 

 
Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, particularly in older adults. An ischemic stroke occurs when the blood vessels leading to or in the brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow. Blocked or narrowed blood vessels are caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels or by blood clots or other debris that travel through your bloodstream and lodge in the blood vessels in your brain.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

**Non-Fatal Modeling Strategy**

Stroke was defined according to WHO criteria - rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (at times global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin. Data on transient ischemic attack (TIA) were not included. 
[WHO-Stroke-Definition-IS]_ 
Ischemic stroke is defined by GBD as an episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal cerebral, spinal, or retinal infarction. We model first ever strokes as acute events; recurrent strokes are captured in the chronic phase of the modeling process. 

For ischemic stroke, data using alternate definitions of incidence and excess mortality were adjusted relative to the reference case definition using MR-BRT. The reference case definition for ischemic stroke is first ever, subtype-specific data which also includes subjects who did not survive to hospital admission. We incorporate data from the scientific literature, registries, and administrative inpatient records in our analysis.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------


Scope
+++++

This cause model is designed to simulate the occurrence of first and recurrent acute ischemic stroke. It is not designed to simulate recurrent events where the second event is a different type of stroke. When incorporating risk factors, BMI, SBP, LDL cholesterol, smoking, FPG, physical inactivity, and total alcohol consumption should affect transition rates 1 and 3 through the GBD measure of incidence for each stroke cause. 


Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Stroke cases are considered acute from the day of incidence of a first-ever stroke through day 28 following the event. The GBD category of chronic stroke includes the sequelae of an acute stroke AND all recurrent stroke events. Stroke cases are considered chronic beginning 28 days following the occurrence of an event. The incidence rate of first ever strokes and recurrent strokes are considered to be the same.
