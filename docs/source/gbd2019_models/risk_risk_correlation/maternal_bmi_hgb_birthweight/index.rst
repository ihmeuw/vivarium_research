Maternal BMI, Maternal Hemoglobin, and Infant Birthweight Risk Correlation
=============================================================================

Risk Exposures Overview
------------------------

Maternal undernourishment, including correlated body mass index (BMI) and anemia exposures, is associated adverse child health outcomes, including infant birthweight.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
----------------------------

Correlation
++++++++++++

.. note::

   The strategy for modeling these risk-risk correlations related was developed for the needs of the :ref:`Intravenous Iron Intervention simulation <2019_concept_model_vivarium_iv_iron>`. Different strategies may be more appropriate for different project needs and should be reevaluated when necessary.

We will model an association between a joint categorical distribution of maternal BMI and hemoglobin with infant birthweight. The association between maternal BMI/hemoglobin categories will be measured in continuous shifts in infant birthweight. The magnitude of these shifts were informed from [Woman-First-Trial-Shifts]_ data as provided by the BMGF (this data is also used to inform the :ref:`pregnancy BMI risk exposure conditional on hemoglobin levels <2019_risk_exposure_maternal_bmi_hgb>` and is discussed in more detail on that page). :download:`A summary of the data is available here <BMGF trial data.docx>`. :download:`Mean differences and associated confidence intervals were calculated in this document <md calculations.xlsx>`.

.. note::

   Modeling strategy may be adapted if BMGF data is available for proportion born with low BW (<2500g) only (rather than mean birthweight). Briefly, in this case, we will use the probability born low birth weight for each maternal BMI/hemoglobin category to sample from LBWSG exposure categories with BW<2500 grams or from categories with BW>=2500g rather than apply shifts to birthweight values sampled from the overall LBWSG exposure distribution.

      - <10
      - -275 (95% CI: -336, -213; normal distribution of uncertainty)
      - Relative to cat4
   
Given that,

.. math::

   BW_\text{cat{1,2,3} - cat4} = \overline{BW}_\text{cat{1,2,3}} - \overline{BW}_\text{cat4}

.. math::

   \overline{BW}_{population} = \sum_{cat}^{n} p_\text{cat} * \overline{BW}_\text{cat}

Then the difference between maternal BMI strata and the population mean can be represented as:

.. math::

   BW_\text{cat4 - population} = p_\text{cat1} * BW_\text{cat1 - cat4}
                           + p_\text{cat2} * BW_\text{cat2 - cat4}
                           + p_\text{cat3} * BW_\text{cat3 - cat4}

Where :math:`p_\text{cat}` represents the exposure prevalence of a given maternal BMI/hemoglobin category.

.. todo::

   Tailor this section to exact structure of data we get from BMGF... may make more sense to calculate difference from population mean BW from BMGF data directly rather than from GBD population mean.

Therefore, the association between maternal BMI/hemoglobin joint risk exposure and birthweight risk exposure should be implemented according to the following steps:

#. Assign maternal hemoglobin risk exposure values as described on the :ref:`hemoglobin exposure document <2019_hemoglobin_model>`

#. Assign maternal BMI risk exposure values as described on the :ref:`maternal BMI risk exposure conditional on hemoglobin status document <2019_risk_exposure_maternal_bmi_hgb>`

#. At *conception* (transition from *np* to *p* states of the :ref:`pregnancy model <other_models_pregnancy>`), assign a LBWSG exposure as described on the :ref:`GBD 2019 Low birthweight short gestation risk exposure page <2019_risk_exposure_lbwsg>`

#. Apply a shift to the assigned continuous birthweight exposure value from step 2 based on the assigned maternal BMI exposure such that:

.. math::

   BW_\text{i, shifted} = BW_\text{i, unshifted} + shift_\text{cat_i, adjusted}

Where,

      - :math:`p_\text{cat1} * shift_\text{cat1, unadjusted} + p_\text{cat2} * shift_\text{cat2, unadjusted} + p_\text{cat3} * shift_\text{cat3, unadjusted}`
      -

      - :math:`shift_\text{cat4, adjusted} + shift_\text{cat3, unadjusted}`
      -

      - :math:`shift_\text{cat4, adjusted} + shift_\text{cat2, unadjusted}`
      - 
   *  - :math:`shift_\text{cat1, adjusted}`
      - :math:`shift_\text{cat4, adjusted} + shift_\text{cat1, unadjusted}`
      - 

.. note::

   These LBWSG exposure values may be later modified by intervention coverage and/or other factors. Note that a shift in continuous LBWSG exposure values may cause a simulant's LBWSG exposure value to no longer fall within a valid GBD LBWSG exposure category. However, relative risks for the shifted exposure can still be calculated according to the :ref:`LBWSG risk effects modeling strategy <2019_risk_effect_lbwsg>`.

   The gestational age assigned to the mother should be used to determine the duration of her pregnancy.

   The gestational age and birtweight exposure values assigned to the mother should be used to determine the child's LBWSG exposure value and relative risks during the neonatal period.

Causation
++++++++++++

We are not currently modeling a direct causal relationship between changes in maternal BMI exposure and changes in birthweight exposure.

Assumptions and Limitations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. We are limited in that we consider only the population mean difference in birthweight among categorical BMI/hemoglobin strata rather than continuous measures of maternal BMI and hemoglobin, which would allow for a more detailed association between the two risk exposures.

#. We assume that neither maternal BMI or anemia status is correlated with baseline intervention coverage (specifically IFA).

#. We apply an estimate of population level mean difference as an additive shift to individual simulants in our population rather than sampling from LBWSG exposuredistributions specific to maternal BMI/hemoglobin strata. This approach assumes that the shape of the LBWSG exposure distribution does not vary between maternal BMI/hemoglobin strata and is in inherent limitation in this approach due to limited data availability.

#. We use data from trial populations that are not representative of our simulated populations.

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++++

#. The exposure distribution of birthweight in the baseline scenario should continue to validate to the GBD birthweight exposure distribution

#. The difference in population mean birthweight among the exposed categories should reflect the expected shifts.
