Risk Exposure Overview
++++++++++++++++++++++

Malnutrition is an imbalance between the body’s needs and its use and intake of nutrients. The imbalance can be caused by poor or lacking diet, poor hygiene, disease states, lack of knowledge, and cultural practices, among others. Underweight, stunting, wasting, obesity, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies are all forms of malnutrition. 

**Acute malnutrition (AM)**, also referred to as wasting, is recent rapid weight loss or a failure to gain weight that results from illness, lack of appropriate foods, or other underlying causes. For an individual, AM is not a chronic condition: children with AM either recover or die and recovered children can relapse to AM. It is measured in weight-for-height z-scores (WFH) which is a comparison of a child’s WFH from the median value of the global reference population. A z-score between -2 to -3 indicates moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and a z-score below -3 indicate severe acute malnutrition (SAM). WHZ z-scores range from -7 to +7. Although MAM is less severe, it affects a greater number of children and is associated with more nutrition-related deaths than SAM. Children with AM are at greater risk of death from diarrhea and other infectious diseases than well-nourished children. They also face greater risk of morbidity from infectious diseases and delayed physical and cognitive development. AM tends to peak during seasonal hunger, disease outbreaks, or during food security ‘shocks’ (e.g. economic or climatic crises) and stresses including humanitarian crises. However, AM is a problem that not only occurs in emergencies, but also can be endemic in development contexts. MAM should not be neglected, as untreated, it can deteriorate to SAM and possible death. Furthermore, evidence is emerging that repeated episodes of MAM can have a significant impact on stunting; prevention of wasting could potentially increase height in children.

Risk Exposures Description in GBD
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _waste_exp1.1.1:

Case definition
---------------

Wasting, a sub-compoonent indicator of child growth failure (CGF), is based on a categorical definition using the WHO 2006 growth standards for children 0-59 months. Definitions are based on Z-cores from the growth standards, which were derived from an international reference population. Mild, moderate and severe categorical prevalences were estimated for each of the three indicators. Theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) for wasting was assigned to be greater than or equal to one standard deviation below the mean (-1 SD) of the WHO 2006 standard weight-for-height curve. This has not changed since GBD 2010.

+----------------------------------------------+
| Wasting category definition (range -7 to +7) |
+=======+======================================+
| TMREL |  >= -1                               |            
+-------+--------------------------------------+
| MILD  |  < -1 to -2 Z score                  |
+-------+--------------------------------------+
| MAM   |  < -2 to -3 Z score                  |
+-------+--------------------------------------+
| SAM   |  < -3 Z score                        |
+-------+--------------------------------------+

.. _waste_exp1.1.2:

Input data
----------

Two types of input data are used in CGF estimation:  

  1. **Tabulated report data**. This data does not report individual anthropometric measurements. It only reports the prevalence of forms of CGF in a sample size. For example, this data would may report a 15% prevalence of moderate stunting out of a nationally representative sample of 5,000 children.

  2. **Microdata**. This data does have individual anthropometric measurements. From these datasources, GBD can see entire distributions of CGF, while also collapsing them down to point prevalences like moderate and severe CGF. 


.. _waste_exp1.1.3:

Exposure estimation
------------------- 

In modeling CGF, all data types go into ST-GPR modeling. We have STGPR models for moderate, severe, and mean stunting, wasting, and underweight. The output of these STGPR models is an estimate of moderate, severe, and mean stunting, wasting, and underweight for all under 5 age groups, all locations, both sexes, and all years. 

We also take the microdata sources and fit ensemble distributions to the shapes of the stunting, wasting, and underweight distributions. By doing this we can find characteristic shapes of stunting, wasting, and underweight curves. Once we have ST-GPR output as well as weights that define characteristic curve shapes, the last step is to combine them. We anchor the curves at the mean output from ST-GPR, use the curve shape from the ensemble distribution modeling, and then use an optimization function to find the standard deviation value that allows us to stretch/shrink the curve to best match the moderate and severe CGF estimates we got from ST-GPR. The final CGF estimates are the area under the curve for this optimized curve.

Note that the z-score ranges from -7 to +7. If we limit ourselves to Z-scores between -4 and +4, we will be excluding a lot of kids.

.. note::
  In the paper that Ryan (GBD modeller for CGF and LWBSG) is working on right now, he presents the first results ever for "extreme" stunting which we define as kids with stunting Z scores below -4. For Ethiopia, that's about 7% of kids. So it's non-trivial!


.. _waste_exp1.1.4:

Outcomes affected by wasting
----------------------------

CGF burden does not start until *after* neonatal age groups (from 1mo onwards). In the neonatal age groups (0-1mo), burden comes from LBWSG. From post-neonatal (1mo+) age onwards, CGF outcomes affected include lower-respiratory disease (LRI), diarrheal disease (DD), measles, and protein energy malnutrition (PEM). The literature on interventions for wasting target age groups 6mo onwards. This coincides with the timing of supplementary food introduction. Prior to 6mo, interventions to reduce DALYs focus on breastfeeding and reduction of LBWSG.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will build a duration based Markov chain finite state state transition model for progression and recovery of acute malnutrition calibrated to GBD 2019 prevalence of wasting. We do this progressively frrom a wasting only model to one with causes and disease feedback. The arrows in the model diagram figures represent the transition probabilities into and out of each state which determines the movement of children in and out of each state. 

We first build

  1. 1x4 state model with wasting only
  2. 2x4 state model with 2 disease states and 4 wasting states
  3. 2x4 state model with 2 disease states and 4 wasting states with death and fertility (tbd)

Finite state machine 1x4 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. image:: wasting_state_1x4.svg

To solve the 10 transition pobabilities, we use a Markov Chain transition matrix **T**. 

T = 

.. csv-table:: 
   :file: wasting_state_1x4.csv
   :widths: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5


:math:`π_{T}` = 

+----+----+----+----+
| p4 | p3 | p2 | p1 |
+----+----+----+----+

:math:`π_{T}` is the eigenvector at equilibrium

  a) :math:`π_{T}\times\text{T} = π_{T}` (the T means transposed, this is a 1 row vector)
  b) :math:`\sum_{\text{i=p}}` = :math:`π_{T}`
  c) :math:`π_{i}` ≥ 0 , these are GBD 2019 age/sex/location/year-specific prevalence for wasting categories 1-4


Solving a)

  1)  :math:`p_4s_4 + p_3r_4 = p_4` 
  2)  :math:`p_4i_3 + p_3s_3 + p_2r_3 = p_3`
  3)  :math:`p_3i_2 + p_2s_2 + p_1r_2 = p_2`
  4)  :math:`p_2i_1 + p_1xs_1 = p_1`


Rows of the P matrix sums to 1

  5)  :math:`s_4 + i_3 = 1`
  6)  :math:`r_4 + s_3 + i_2 = 1`
  7)  :math:`r_3 + s_2 + i_1 = 1`
  8)  :math:`r_2 + s_1 = 1`

We have duration of treated and untreated sam and mam as well as coverage from the literature :   

  9)  :math:`r_2 = 1/Dsam`   
  10) :math:`r_3 + i_1  = 1/Dmam`
  11) :math:`i_2 + r_4 = 1/dur\_cat3`

where

 - Duration of cat 1: Dsam = C x Dsam_tx + (1-C)Dsam_ux ~ 40 days stand in value (will refine)
 - Duration of cat 2: Dmam = C x Dmam_tx + (1-C)Dmam_ux ~ 70 days stand in value (will refine)
 - Duration of cat 3: :math:`1 / (i_2 + r_4)`. We still need more values from the literature to solve for this.
 - tx is treated
 - ux is untreated
 - C is treatment coverage proportion



We solve this system of equations in terms of :math:`p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4` and one unknown;
for now, this unknown is :math:`dur\_cat3`, which we will assume to be :math:`1/365` until we
find values from the literature with which to update this.

Solving in terms of :math:`i_3`, we get:

Finite state machine 1x4 + death
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the above section we calculated the transition probabilities assuming that 
all simulants exist in one of the four wasting categories. The transition 
probabilities are thus incorrect, because simulants never die. In reality, we 
expect children to age into the four wasting categories, and to die out of SAM 
at a higher rate than out of MAM, mild wasting, or the TMREL. Thus in the above model, we 
expect simulants who ought to be dying to instead be remitting to MAM.

Here we correct this by allowing simulants to die into **CAT 0** at differential 
rates. However, as we still need to assume equilibrium across the wasting states 
over time, we allow sims to age in to the four wasting categories out of 
**CAT 0**, our "reincarnation pool". We then set the transition probabilies 
:math:`f_i` equal to the prevalence of the four wasting categories.

.. image:: wasting_state_1x4_plus_death.svg

It is important here to note first that :math:`f_i` don't represent fertility rates, 
but rather that we only allow enough sims to age in each timestep necessary to 
replenish those that died. Second, we emphasize that we utilize this method in 
order to calculate transition rates between the different wasting categories. 
However, the final Vivarium model of wasting will not include a reincarnation 
pool.

Here we include equations for the transition probabilities, and in the section 
that follows we will detail how to calculate all the variables used

We now detail how the above wasting rate transition equations were derived.

.. todo::
  Consider adding all code for calculating above eqns.


As in the previous section, we solve our transition probabilities using a 
Markov Chain transition matrix **T**. 

T = 

.. csv-table:: 
   :file: wasting_state_1x4_death.csv
   :widths: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5


:math:`π_{T}` = 

+----+----+----+----+----+
| p4 | p3 | p2 | p1 | p0 |
+----+----+----+----+----+

:math:`π_{T}` is the eigenvector at equilibrium

  a) :math:`π_{T}\times\text{T} = π_{T}` (the T means transposed, this is a 1 row vector)
  b) :math:`\sum_{\text{i=p}}` = :math:`π_{T}`
  c) :math:`π_{i}` ≥ 0 , these are GBD 2019 age/sex/location/year-specific prevalence for wasting categories 1-4, plus :math:`p0`, which will equal the number of people who die in a timestep


Solving a)

  1)  :math:`ap_4s_4 + ap_3r_4 + ap_0f_4 = ap_4` 
  2)  :math:`ap_4i_3 + ap_3s_3 + ap_2r_3 + ap_0f_3 = ap_3`
  3)  :math:`ap_3i_2 + ap_2s_2 + ap_1r_2 + ap_0f_2 = ap_2`
  4)  :math:`ap_2i_1 + ap_1s_1 + ap_0f_1 = ap_1`
  5)  :math:`ap_4d_4 + ap_3d_3 + ap_2d_2 + ap_1d_1=ap_0`

Rows of the P matrix sums to 1

  6)  :math:`s_4 + i_3 + d-4 = 1`
  7)  :math:`r_4 + s_3 + i_2 + d_3 = 1`
  8)  :math:`r_3 + s_2 + i_1 + d_2 = 1`
  9)  :math:`r_2 + s_1 + d_1 = 1`
  10) :math:`f_4+f_3+f_2+f_1=1`

We have duration of treated and untreated sam and mam as well as coverage from the literature :   

  11) :math:`r_2 + d_1 = 1/duration\_cat_1`
  12) :math:`r_3 + i_1 + d_2 = 1/duration\_cat_2`
  13) :math:`i_2 + r_4 + d_3 = 1/duration\_cat_3`

where

 - Duration of cat 1: Dsam = C x Dsam_tx + (1-C)Dsam_ux ~ 40 days stand in value (will refine)
 - Duration of cat 2: Dmam = C x Dmam_tx + (1-C)Dmam_ux ~ 70 days stand in value (will refine)
 - Duration of cat 3: :math:`1 / (i_2 + r_4)`. ~ 365 days (will refine)
 - tx is treated
 - ux is untreated
 - C is treatment coverage proportion

    Foundation has a way to calculate this from their KI database.
