Systolic Blood Pressure
======================================

Risk Exposure Overview
----------------------

Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP), and presented as the ratio of SBP/DBP. SBP indicates how much pressure the blood is exerting against the artery walls when the heart contracts, while DBP indicates how much pressure the blood is exerting against the artery walls while the heart is resting between beats. Typically, SBP rises with age due to increased stiffness in the larger arteries. SBP is usually given more attention as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, but elevated DBP (even in the absence of elevated SBP) has also been shown to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Thresholds for defining clinical hypertension (high blood pressure) vary between guidelines set by different bodies (AHA/ACC >130/80 mm Hg; ESC >140/90 mm Hg).

Risk Exposures Description in GBD
---------------------------------

In GBD, systolic blood pressure is modeled as a continuous variable using ST-GPR based on blood pressure readings from population-based surveys and scientific studies. The quantity of interest is exposure to the mean blood pressure level regardless of whether that level is naturally occurring or occurs via use of medication; we assume full reversibility of risk and do not account for duration of exposure to elevated SBP.  

To account for in-person variation in systolic blood pressure, a “usual blood pressure” adjustment was done. The need for this adjustment has been described elsewhere. Briefly, measurements of a risk factor taken at a single time point may not accurately capture an individual’s true long-term exposure to that risk. Blood pressure readings are highly variable over time due to measurement error as well as diurnal, seasonal, or biological variation. These sources of variation result in an overestimation of the variation in cross-sectional studies of the distribution of SBP.  

To adjust for this overestimation, we applied a correction factor to each location-, age-, time-, and sex-specific standard deviation. These correction factors were age-specific and represented the proportion of the variation in blood pressure within a population that would be observed if there were no within-person variation across time. Four longitudinal surveys were used to estimate these factors: the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHRLS), the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiological Follow-up Study (NHANES I/EFS), and the South Africa National Income Dynamics Survey (NIDS). 

The theoretical minimum risk exposure was defined as a range between 110 to 115 mm Hg. This is the same for all risk-outcome pairs. These are listed below:

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Mean SBP is a continuous exposure modelled in GBD using an ensemble distribution. SBP will be a target of medication interventions in the simulation; the outcomes affected are described in the overall concept model document.

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The quantity of interest is exposure to the mean blood pressure level regardless of whether that level is naturally occurring or occurs via use of medication; we assume full reversibility of risk and do not account for duration of exposure to elevated SBP. 

Data Description

The exposure values should be used to represent the distribution of mean blood pressure values that the simulants will be assigned in the model. 

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

Does the mean in the model match the mean in GBD? 

Does the standard deviation in the model match the standard deviation in GBD?
