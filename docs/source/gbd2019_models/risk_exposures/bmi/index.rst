Body Mass Index
======================================


Risk Exposure Overview
----------------------

Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (weight (kg) / [height (m)]\ :sup:`2`\). BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening method; values are frequently divided into categories: underweight (<18.5 kg/m\ :sup:`2`\), healthy weight (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m\ :sup:`2`\), overweight (25.0 to 29.9 kg/m\ :sup:`2`\), and obese (>=30.0 kg/m\ :sup:`2`\). BMI does not measure body fat directly, but it is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat. BMI has also been shown to be correlated with various metabolic and disease outcomes. BMI can be a screening tool, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.

Risk Exposures Description in GBD
---------------------------------

In GBD, BMI is modeled as a continuous variable using ST-GPR based on measured and self-reported height and weight measurements and sources reporting tabulated BMI categories.  

**Self-report bias adjustment:**\

We included both measured and self-reported data. We tested for bias in self-report data compared to measured data, which is considered to be the gold-standard. For individuals ages 15 and above, we adjusted self-reported data for overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence using sex-specific MR-BRT models on the logit difference between measured and self-reported BMI with a fixed effect on super-region. 

**Prevalence estimation for overweight and obesity:**\

After adjusting for self-report bias and splitting aggregated data into five-year age-sex groups, we used spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) to estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity.  

**Estimating mean BMI:**\

To estimate the mean BMI for adults in each country, age, and sex, over the time period 1980–2019, we first used a nested hierarchical mixed-effects model, fit using restricted maximum likelihood on data from sources containing estimates of all three indicators (prevalence of overweight, prevalence of obesity, and mean BMI), in order to characterise the relationship between overweight, obesity, and mean BMI. We applied 1000 draws of the regression coefficients to the 1000 draws of overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence produced through ST-GPR to estimate 1000 draws of mean BMI for each country, year, age, and sex. This approach ensured that overweight prevalence, obesity prevalence, and mean BMI were correlated at the draw level and uncertainty was propagated. 

**Estimating BMI distribution:**\

We used the standard GBD ensemble approach to estimate the distribution of BMI. 

**Theoretical minimum risk exposure level:**\

For adults (ages 20+), the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) of BMI (20–25 kg/m\ :sup:`2`\) was determined based on the BMI level that was associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality in prospective cohort studies. This is the same for all risk-outcome pairs. These are listed below:

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Mean BMI is a continuous exposure modelled in GBD using an ensemble distribution. BMI will be a target of lifestyle interventions in the simulation; the outcomes affected are described in the overall concept model document.

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The quantity of interest is exposure to the mean BMI level; we assume full reversibility of risk and do not account for duration of exposure to BMI values above the range of the TMREL. 


Data Description
++++++++++++++++

The rei_id for BMI is 108

	  - Must be accessed with get_draws; adult values

The exposure and standard deviation values should be used to represent the distribution of mean BMI values that the simulants will be assigned in the model. 

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

Does the mean in the model match the mean in GBD? 

Does the standard deviation in the model match the standard deviation of the GBD model?
