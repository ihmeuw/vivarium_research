GBD 2019 Static Child Wasting Model and Protein Energy Malnutrition

Overview
++++++++

This page contains information pertaining to the *static* joint risk-cause wasting model. An :ref:`alternative dynamic transition model of wasting exposure (specific to GBD 2020) is described elsewhere <2020_risk_exposure_wasting_state_exposure>`. Given that wasting is generally considered an acute rather than chronic condition, it is more appropriate to model it as a dynamic transition model. However, a dynamic exposure model of child wasting is not modeled by GBD and is complex and data intensive. As a simplication to the :ref:`dynamic transition wasting model <2020_risk_exposure_wasting_state_exposure>` used for the :ref:`acute malnutrition simulation <2019_concept_model_vivarium_ciff_sam>`, this document will describe a propensity-based *static* child wasting exposure modeling strategy for 2019 similar to the modeling strategy for :ref:`GBD 2020 child stunting exposure <2020_risk_exposure_child_stunting>`.

GBD stratifies wasting 
into four categories: TMREL, mild, moderate, and severe wasting. All PEM cases 
are attributed to moderate and severe wasting, making PEM a PAF-of-1 model. 
Under the GBD framework, wasting is additionally a risk for measles, diarrheal diseases, 
and lower respiratory infections. These relationships are detailed under the 
:ref:`risk effects page for wasting <2019_risk_effect_wasting>`.

Protein Energy Malnutrition in GBD 2019

PEM is a PAF-of-1 cause with child wasting in GBD 2019 among the unrestricted ages for child wasting. There are fatal and non-fatal components.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The wasting exposure model should be implemented as a propensity risk exposure model such that a simulant's child wasting exposure state may change as they age into the next age group, but their child wasting percentile within the population will remain constant.

If a simulant is in wasting risk exposure :code:`cat1` or :code:`cat2`, they should be considered "infected" with severe and moderate PEM (respectively) and accrue YLDs according to the disability weights as well as experience the associated excess mortality rates defined in the table below.

      - Severe wasting with edema (from the GBD 2019 risk appendix table S13)

  NOTE: It looks like these sequelae descriptions are mislabeled if logical numbering patterns were followed, but I have confirmed they are correct despite this suspicion.

Validation 
++++++++++

- Wasting exposure state person time should validate to GBD wasting risk exposure
- PEM exposure state person time, CSMR, EMR, YLDs, and YLLs should validate to GBD prevalence
- Moderate PEM state person time should occur among those in wasting exposure cat2 only 
- Severe PEM state person time should occur among those in wasting exposure cat1 only 

Assumptions and limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are modeling wasting as a chronic condition rather than the acute condition that it is. This may cause us to overestimate wasting burden among the population afflicted with correlated factors and vise versa. Additionally, we may underestimate wasting exposures in the older age groups as simulants with propensities for wasting exposure will die at a higher rate than those without. We also assume that moderate and severe PEM have equal excess mortality rates when it is likely higher for severe PEM.
