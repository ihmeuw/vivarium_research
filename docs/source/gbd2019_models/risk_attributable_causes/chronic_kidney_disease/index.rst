Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
============================

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by NIH as kidneys that are damaged and canâ€™t filter blood the way they should. The main risk factors for developing kidney disease are diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and a family history of kidney failure. National Kidney Foundation (NKF) adds that CKD is also known as chronic renal disease. You may develop complications like high blood pressure, anemia (low blood count), weak bones, poor nutritional health and nerve damage. Also, kidney disease increases your risk of having heart and blood vessel disease. These problems may happen slowly over a long period of time. Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. When kidney disease progresses, it may eventually lead to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

According to GBD 2019, Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as a permanent loss of renal function as indicated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). The GBD study considers six stages of CKD as defined by degree of loss of renal function or receipt of renal replacement therapy: CKD stages I & II (also known as Albuminuria) (eGFR > 60ml/min/1.73m2 and ACR > 30 mg/g), CKD Stage III (eGFR 30-60ml/min/1.73m2), CKD Stage IV (eGFR 15-30ml/min/1.73m2), CKD Stage V (eGFR <15ml/min/1.73m2, not on kidney replacement therapy), maintenance dialysis, and kidney transplantation.

The estimation strategy used for fatal chronic kidney disease is largely similar to methods used in GBD
2017. A standard CODEm model with location-level covariates was used to model deaths due to chronic
kidney disease. In GBD 2019, the bias adjustment methods were improved by utilizing a MR-BRT model outside of DisMod
to allow a more direct comparison between different case definitions and/or study designs. In GBD 2017,
these adjustments were performed within DisMod.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy

.. todo:: Meet with RT if the cause model design should be replicated from GBD 2017 or if this will need to be adjusted, for the MM use case.

Scope
+++++

The aspects of the disease this cause model is designed to simulate is the basic structure of the disease, its sub causes, associated measures (deaths, prevalence, incidence, emr), associated sequelae, and associated disability weights. The aspects of the disease this cause model is not designed to simulate is the disease progression of CKD, as this model does not contain transitions between CKD states/stages. This cause model is designed differently, with a transient disease state titled 'With Condition' based on incidence of CKD. From there, the sub causes and sequelae are categorized within either a 'moderate' or 'severe' CKD state. Across the 5 CKD sub causes, some of the associated sequelae will either be grouped into the 'Moderate' or 'Severe' CKD state. The sequelae which map to 'Severe' CKD state include end stage renal disease sequelae and all Stage V CKD sequelae. All other sequelae are included in the 'Moderate' CKD. The associated sequelae in each state can be found below in the 'State Severity Split Definitions' table.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy for Risk Factor Impaired Kidney Function (IKF) 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Initialization:
- In this model, simulants are initialized as "susceptible" or "with specific sequelae-level condition" through the following process: simulants will be assigned directly to a CKD sequelae ("with condition" state) based on each sequelae prevalence. Those not assigned to a sequelae will be initialized to the "susceptible" state. Each sequelae will then be mapped back to the distribution of IKF based on sequelae based severity splits. The result will be an IKF value for each simulant that is consistent with sub-cause prevalence. 

Progress:
-As simulants age, their risk exposure will change, which may result in them progressing into a different disease state over time. Also, simulants will experience mortality based on their risk exposure.

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assumptions
+++++++++++

- Presently, we are using prevalence for each stage of CKD to assign the each person in the population a CKD severity state. We are assuming (for now) that there is no transition between states. As a result, we should expect the prevalence for early stage CKD to swell as the simulation runs, since there is nowhere for these new incident cases to go. Transition rates (progression rates) between states are not available from the GBD model. As such, we are using evolution of risk exposure over time (changes with simulant age) to proxy for progression between CKD states - as a simulant ages, they may move to a different part of the IDF distribution, thereby landing them in a more advanced CKD state. The reason we are modeling CKD this way is because it is a condition for treatment of LDL-C, which is the intervention in this model. Thus, we need to get the prevalence at each severity (mild/moderate v. severe) correct. CKD is not a cause of interest in the current project it is being modeled in, so the severity specific prevalence is the current priority.

- Simulants are in each disease state longer than they should be, compared to GBD 2017. 

- This model assumes there is no impact of SBP nor FPG on CKD.

Limitations
+++++++++++

- This model is consistent with prevalence in population. The following relationships between CKD/SBP and CKD/FPG will be modeled using correlation. The iniitial distribution will be correct, but will change over time and become inaccurate due to mitigating factors.
